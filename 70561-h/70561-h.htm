  <h2 id='intro-notice' class='c004'>INTRODUCTORY NOTICE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>The name of the illustrious Origen comes before us
in this volume in connection with his works <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>De
Principiis</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Epistola ad Africanum</i></span>, and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Contra
Celsum</i></span>. Of these, the first two have been given
entire, while of the third we have been able at present only
to give the first book. A full account of the life and writings
of the author will be prefixed to our next volume of his works.
Meanwhile, we restrict ourselves to a brief notice of the three
which have been mentioned.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is in his treatise <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Περὶ Ἀρχῶν</span>, or, as it is commonly
known under the Latin title, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>De Principiis</i></span>, that Origen
most fully develops his system, and brings out his peculiar
principles. None of his works exposed him to so much
animadversion in the ancient church as this. On it chiefly was
based the charge of heresy which some vehemently pressed
against him,—a charge from which even his firmest friends
felt it no easy matter absolutely to defend him. The points
on which it was held that he had plainly departed from the
orthodox faith, were the four following:—<i>First</i>, That the
souls of men had existed in a previous state, and that their
imprisonment in material bodies was a punishment for sins
which they had then committed. <i>Second</i>, That the human
soul of Christ had also previously existed, and been united
to the Divine nature before that incarnation of the Son of
God which is related in the Gospels. <i>Third</i>, That our
material bodies shall be transformed into absolutely ethereal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>ones at the resurrection; and <i>fourth</i>, That all men, and
even devils, shall be finally restored through the mediation
of Christ. His principles of interpreting Scripture are also
brought out in this treatise; and while not a little ingenuity
is displayed in illustrating and maintaining them, the serious
errors into which they might too easily lead will be at once
perceived by the reader.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is much to be regretted that the original Greek of the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>De Principiis</i></span> has for the most part perished. We possess
it chiefly in a Latin translation by Rufinus. And there can
be no doubt that he often took great liberties with his author.
So much was this felt to be the case, that Jerome undertook
a new translation of the work; but only small portions of his
version have reached our day. He strongly accuses Rufinus
of unfaithfulness as an interpreter, while he also inveighs
bitterly against Origen himself, as having departed from
the catholic faith, specially in regard to the doctrine of the
Trinity. There seems, however, after all, no adequate reason
to doubt the substantial orthodoxy of our author, although
the bent of his mind and the nature of his studies led him
to indulge in many vain and unauthorized speculations.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>Epistle to Africanus</i> was drawn forth by a letter
which that learned writer had addressed to Origen respecting
the story of Susanna appended to the book of Daniel.
Africanus had grave doubts as to the canonical authority
of the account. Origen replies to his objections, and seeks
to uphold the story as both useful in itself, and a genuine
portion of the ancient prophetical writings.</p>

<p class='c006'>The treatise of Origen <i>Against Celsus</i> is, of all his works,
the most interesting to the modern reader. It is a defence
of Christianity in opposition to a Greek philosopher named
Celsus, who had attacked it in a work entitled <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἀληθὴς
Λόγος</span>, that is, <i>The True Word</i>, or <i>The True Discourse</i>. Of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>this work we know nothing, except from the quotations contained
in the answer given to it by Origen. Nor has anything
very certain been ascertained respecting its author. According
to Origen, he was a follower of Epicurus, but others have
regarded him as a Platonist. If we may judge of the work
by those specimens of it preserved in the reply of Origen,
it was little better than a compound of sophistry and slander.
But there is reason to be grateful for it, as having called forth
the admirable answer of Origen. This work was written in
the old age of our author, and is composed with great care;
while it abounds with proofs of the widest erudition. It is
also perfectly orthodox; and, as Bishop Bull has remarked,
it is only fair that we should judge from a work written
with the view of being considered by the world at large, and
with the most elaborate care, as to the mature and finally
accepted views of the author.</p>

<p class='c006'>The best edition of Origen’s works is that superintended
by Charles and Charles Vincent de la Rue, Paris 1783,
4 <abbr title='volumes'>vols.</abbr> <abbr title='folio'>fol.</abbr>, which is reprinted by Migne. There is also an
edition in 25 volumes, based upon that of De la Rue, but
without the Latin translation, by Lommatzsch, Berlin 1831-1848.
The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>De Principiis</i></span> has been separately edited by
Redepenning, Leipzig 1836. Spencer edited the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Contra
Celsum</i></span>, Cambridge 1677.</p>

  <h2 id='intro-prologue' class='c004'>PROLOGUE OF RUFINUS TO THE DE PRINCIPIIS.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>I know that very many of the brethren, induced
by their thirst for a knowledge of the Scriptures,
have requested some distinguished men, well
versed in Greek learning, to translate Origen into
Latin, and so make him accessible to Roman readers. Among
these, when our brother and colleague<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c007'><sup>[1]</sup></a> had, at the earnest
entreaty of Bishop Damasus, translated two of the Homilies
on the Song of Songs out of Greek into Latin, he prefixed
so elegant and noble a preface to that work, as to inspire
every one with a most eager desire to read and study Origen,
saying that the expression, “The King hath brought me into
his chamber,”<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c007'><sup>[2]</sup></a> was appropriate to his feelings, and declaring
that while Origen in his other works surpassed all writers, he
in the Song of Songs surpassed even himself. He promises,
indeed, in that very preface, that he will present the books
on the Song of Songs, and numerous others of the works of
Origen, in a Latin translation, to Roman readers. But he,
finding greater pleasure in compositions of his own, pursues an
end that is attended with greater fame, viz. in being the author
rather than the translator of works. Accordingly we enter
upon the undertaking, which was thus begun and approved of
by him, although we cannot compose in a style of elegance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>equal to that of a man of such distinguished eloquence;
and therefore I am afraid lest, through my fault, the result
should follow, that that man, whom he deservedly esteems as
the second teacher of knowledge and wisdom in the church
after the apostles, should, through the poverty of my language,
appear far inferior to what he is. And this consideration,
which frequently recurred to my mind, kept me silent,
and prevented me from yielding to the numerous entreaties of
my brethren, until your influence, my very faithful brother
Macarius, which is so great, rendered it impossible for my
unskilfulness any longer to offer resistance. And therefore,
that I might not find you too grievous an exactor, I gave
way, even contrary to my resolution; on the condition and
arrangement, however, that in my translation I should follow
as far as possible the rule observed by my predecessors,
and especially by that distinguished man whom I have mentioned
above, who, after translating into Latin more than
seventy of those treatises of Origen which are styled <i>Homilies</i>,
and a considerable number also of his writings on the
apostles, in which a good many “stumbling-blocks” are found
in the original Greek, so smoothed and corrected them in his
translation, that a Latin reader would meet with nothing
which could appear discordant with our belief. His example,
therefore, we follow, to the best of our ability; if not with
equal power of eloquence, yet at least with the same strictness
of rule, taking care not to reproduce those expressions
occurring in the works of Origen which are inconsistent
with and opposed to each other. The cause of these variations
we have explained more freely in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Apologeticus</i></span>,
which Pamphilus wrote in defence of the works of Origen,
where we added a brief tract, in which we showed, I think,
by unmistakeable proofs, that his books had been corrupted
in numerous places by heretics and malevolent persons, and
especially those books of which you now require me to undertake
the translation, <i>i.e.</i> the books which may be entitled
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>De Principiis</i></span> or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>De Principatibus</i></span>, and which are indeed in
other respects full of obscurities and difficulties. For he
there discusses those subjects with respect to which philosophers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>after spending all their lives upon them, have been
unable to discover anything. But here our author strove, as
much as in him lay, to turn to the service of religion the
belief in a Creator, and the rational nature of created beings,
which the latter had degraded to purposes of wickedness.
If, therefore, we have found anywhere in his writings, any
statement opposed to that view, which elsewhere in his works
he had himself piously laid down regarding the Trinity, we
have either omitted it, as being corrupt, and not the composition
of Origen, or we have brought it forward, agreeably to
the rule which we frequently find affirmed by himself. If,
indeed, in his desire to pass rapidly on, he has, as speaking
to persons of skill and knowledge, sometimes expressed himself
obscurely, we have, in order that the passage might be
clearer, added what we had read more fully stated on the
same subject in his other works, keeping explanation in view,
but adding nothing of our own, but simply restoring to him
what was his, although occurring in other portions of his
writings.</p>

<p class='c006'>These remarks, therefore, by way of admonition, I have
made in the preface, lest slanderous individuals perhaps
should think that they had a second time discovered matter
of accusation. But let perverse and disputatious men have
a care what they are about. For we have in the meantime
undertaken this heavy labour, if God should aid your prayers,
not to shut the mouths of slanderers (which is impossible,
although God perhaps will do it), but to afford material to
those who desire to advance in the knowledge of these things.
And, verily, in the presence of God the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Spirit, I adjure and beseech every
one, who may either transcribe or read these books, by his
belief in the kingdom to come, by the mystery of the resurrection
from the dead, and by that everlasting fire prepared
for the devil and his angels, that, as he would not possess for
an eternal inheritance that place where there is weeping and
gnashing of teeth, and where their fire is not quenched and
their worm dieth not, he add nothing to Scripture, and take
nothing away from it, and make no insertion or alteration,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>but that he compare his transcript with the copies from
which he made it, and make the emendations and distinctions
according to the letter, and not have his manuscript incorrect
or indistinct, lest the difficulty of ascertaining the sense, from
the indistinctness of the copy, should cause greater difficulties
to the readers.</p>

  <h2 id='de-principiis' class='c004'>ORIGEN DE PRINCIPIIS.</h2>
</div>
<h3 id='de-principiis-pref' class='c008'>PREFACE.</h3>
<p class='c005'>1. All who believe and are assured that grace and
truth were obtained through Jesus Christ, and
who know Christ to be the truth, agreeably
to His own declaration, “I am the truth,”<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c007'><sup>[3]</sup></a>
derive the knowledge which incites men to a good and happy
life from no other source than from the very words and
teaching of Christ. And by the words of Christ we do not
mean those only which He spake when He became man and
tabernacled in the flesh; for before that time, Christ, the
Word of God, was in Moses and the prophets. For without
the Word of God, how could they have been able to prophesy
of Christ? And were it not our purpose to confine
the present treatise within the limits of all attainable brevity,
it would not be difficult to show, in proof of this statement,
out of the Holy Scriptures, how Moses or the prophets both
spake and performed all they did through being filled with
the Spirit of Christ. And therefore I think it sufficient to
quote this one testimony of Paul from the Epistle to the
Hebrews, in which he says: “By faith Moses, when he was
come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s
daughter; choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people
of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;
esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the
treasures of the Egyptians.”<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c007'><sup>[4]</sup></a> Moreover, that after His
ascension into heaven He spake in His apostles, is shown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>by Paul in these words: “Or do you seek a proof of Christ,
who speaketh in me?”<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c007'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>2. Since many, however, of those who profess to believe in
Christ differ from each other, not only in small and trifling
matters, but also on subjects of the highest importance, as
<i>e.g.</i> regarding God, or the Lord Jesus Christ, or the Holy
Spirit; and not only regarding these, but also regarding
others which are created existences, viz. the powers<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c007'><sup>[6]</sup></a> and the
holy virtues;<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c007'><sup>[7]</sup></a> it seems on that account necessary first of all
to fix a definite limit and to lay down an unmistakeable rule
regarding each one of these, and then to pass to the investigation
of other points. For as we ceased to seek for truth
(notwithstanding the professions of many among Greeks and
Barbarians to make it known) among all who claimed it for
erroneous opinions, after we had come to believe that Christ
was the Son of God, and were persuaded that we must learn
it from Himself; so, seeing there are many who think they
hold the opinions of Christ, and yet some of these think differently
from their predecessors, yet as the teaching of the
church, transmitted in orderly succession from the apostles,
and remaining in the churches to the present day, is still preserved,
that alone is to be accepted as truth which differs in
no respect from ecclesiastical and apostolical tradition.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. Now it ought to be known that the holy apostles, in
preaching the faith of Christ, delivered themselves with the
utmost clearness on certain points which they believed to be
necessary to every one, even to those who seemed somewhat
dull in the investigation of divine knowledge; leaving, however,
the grounds of their statements to be examined into by
those who should deserve the excellent gifts of the Spirit,
and who, especially by means of the Holy Spirit Himself,
should obtain the gift of language, of wisdom, and of knowledge:
while on other subjects they merely stated the fact
that things were so, keeping silence as to the manner or origin
of their existence; clearly in order that the more zealous of
their successors, who should be lovers of wisdom, might have
a subject of exercise on which to display the fruit of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>talents,—those persons, I mean, who should prepare themselves
to be fit and worthy receivers of wisdom.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. The particular points<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c007'><sup>[8]</sup></a> clearly delivered in the teaching
of the apostles are as follow:</p>

<p class='c006'><i>First</i>, That there is one God, who created and arranged all
things, and who, when nothing existed, called all things into
being—God from the first creation and foundation of the
world—the God of all just men, of Adam, Abel, Seth, Enos,
Enoch, Noe, Sem, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, the twelve patriarchs,
Moses, and the prophets; and that this God in the
last days, as He had announced beforehand by His prophets,
sent our Lord Jesus Christ to call in the first place Israel
to Himself, and in the second place the Gentiles, after the
unfaithfulness of the people of Israel. This just and good
God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Himself gave the
law, and the prophets, and the gospels, being also the God of
the apostles and of the Old and New Testaments.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Secondly</i>, That Jesus Christ Himself, who came [into the
world], was born of the Father before all creatures; that,
after He had been the servant of the Father in the creation
of all things—“For by Him were all things made”<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c007'><sup>[9]</sup></a>—He in
the last times, divesting Himself [of His glory], became a man,
and was incarnate although God, and while made a man
remained the God which He was; that He assumed a body
like to our own, differing in this respect only, that it was
born of a virgin and of the Holy Spirit: that this Jesus
Christ was truly born, and did truly suffer, and did not
endure this death common [to man] in appearance only, but
did truly die; that He did truly rise from the dead; and
that after His resurrection He conversed with His disciples,
and was taken up [into heaven].</p>

<p class='c006'>Then, <i>thirdly</i>, the apostles related that the Holy Spirit was
associated in honour and dignity with the Father and the
Son. But in His case it is not clearly distinguished whether
He is to be regarded as born or innate,<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c007'><sup>[10]</sup></a> or also as a Son of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>God or not: for these are points which have to be inquired
into out of sacred Scripture according to the best of our
ability, and which demand careful investigation. And that
this Spirit inspired each one of the saints, whether prophets
or apostles; and that there was not one Spirit in the men of
the old dispensation, and another in those who were inspired
at the advent of Christ, is most clearly taught throughout
the churches.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. After these points, also, the apostolic teaching is that
the soul, having a substance<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c007'><sup>[11]</sup></a> and life of its own, shall, after
its departure from the world, be rewarded according to its
deserts, being destined to obtain either an inheritance of
eternal life and blessedness, if its actions shall have procured
this for it, or to be delivered up to eternal fire and punishments,
if the guilt of its crimes shall have brought it down to
this: and also, that there is to be a time of resurrection from
the dead, when this body, which now “is sown in corruption,
shall rise in incorruption,” and that which “is sown in dishonour
will rise in glory.”<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c007'><sup>[12]</sup></a> This also is clearly defined in
the teaching of the church, that every rational soul is possessed
of free-will and volition; that it has a struggle to
maintain with the devil and his angels, and opposing influences,<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c007'><sup>[13]</sup></a>
because they strive to burden it with sins; but if
we live rightly and wisely, we should endeavour to shake
ourselves free of a burden of that kind. From which it
follows, also, that we understand ourselves not to be subject
to necessity, so as to be compelled by all means, even against
our will, to do either good or evil. For if we are our own
masters, some influences perhaps may impel us to sin, and
others help us to salvation; we are not forced, however, by
any necessity either to act rightly or wrongly, which those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>persons think is the case who say that the courses and movements
of the stars are the cause of human actions, not only
of those which take place beyond the influence of the freedom
of the will, but also of those which are placed within our own
power. But with respect to the soul, whether it is derived
from the seed by a process of traducianism, so that the reason
or substance of it may be considered as placed in the seminal
particles of the body themselves, or whether it has any other
beginning; and this beginning itself, whether it be by birth
or not, or whether bestowed upon the body from without or
no, is not distinguished with sufficient clearness in the teaching
of the church.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. Regarding the devil and his angels, and the opposing
influences, the teaching of the church has laid down that
these beings exist indeed; but what they are, or how they
exist, it has not explained with sufficient clearness. This
opinion, however, is held by most, that the devil was an angel,
and that, having become an apostate, he induced as many of
the angels as possible to fall away with himself, and these
up to the present time are called his angels.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. This also is a part of the church’s teaching, that the
world was made and took its beginning at a certain time, and
is to be destroyed on account of its wickedness. But what
existed before this world, or what will exist after it, has not
become certainly known to the many, for there is no clear
statement regarding it in the teaching of the church.</p>

<p class='c006'>8. Then, finally, that the Scriptures were written by the
Spirit of God, and have a meaning, not such only as is apparent
at first sight, but also another, which escapes the notice
of most. For those [words] which are written are the forms
of certain mysteries,<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c007'><sup>[14]</sup></a> and the images of divine things. Respecting
which there is one opinion throughout the whole
church, that the whole law is indeed spiritual; but that the
spiritual meaning which the law conveys is not known to all,
but to those only on whom the grace of the Holy Spirit is
bestowed in the word of wisdom and knowledge.</p>

<p class='c006'>The term <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀσώματον</span>, <i>i.e.</i> incorporeal, is disused and unknown,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>not only in many other writings, but also in our own
Scriptures. And if any one should quote it to us out of the
little treatise entitled <i>The Doctrine of Peter</i>,<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c007'><sup>[15]</sup></a> in which the
Saviour seems to say to His disciples, “I am not an incorporeal
demon,”<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c007'><sup>[16]</sup></a> I have to reply, in the first place, that that work
is not included among ecclesiastical books; for we can show
that it was not composed either by Peter or by any other
person inspired by the Spirit of God. But even if the point
were to be conceded, the word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀσώματον</span> there does not convey
the same meaning as is intended by Greek and Gentile
authors when incorporeal nature is discussed by philosophers.
For in the little treatise referred to he used the phrase
“incorporeal demon” to denote that that form or outline
of demoniacal body, whatever it is, does not resemble this
gross and visible body of ours; but, agreeably to the intention
of the author of the treatise, it must be understood to
mean that He had not such a body as demons have, which
is naturally fine,<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c007'><sup>[17]</sup></a> and thin as if formed of air (and for this
reason is either considered or called by many incorporeal),
but that He had a solid and palpable body. Now, according
to human custom, everything which is not of that nature is
called by the simple or ignorant incorporeal; as if one were to
say that the air which we breathe was incorporeal, because
it is not a body of such a nature as can be grasped and held,
or can offer resistance to pressure.</p>

<p class='c006'>9. We shall inquire, however, whether the thing which
Greek philosophers call ἀσώματον, or “incorporeal,” is found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>in holy Scripture under another name. For it is also to be
a subject of investigation how God Himself is to be understood,—whether
as corporeal, and formed according to some
shape, or of a different nature from bodies,—a point which is
not clearly indicated in our teaching. And the same inquiries
have to be made regarding Christ and the Holy Spirit, as
well as respecting every soul, and everything possessed of a
rational nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>10. This also is a part of the teaching of the church, that
there are certain angels of God, and certain good influences,
which are His servants in accomplishing the salvation of men.
When these, however, were created, or of what nature they
are, or how they exist, is not clearly stated. Regarding the
sun, moon, and stars, whether they are living beings or without
life, there is no distinct deliverance.</p>

<p class='c006'>Every one, therefore, must make use of elements and
foundations of this sort, according to the precept, “Enlighten
yourselves with the light of knowledge,”<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c007'><sup>[18]</sup></a> if he would desire
to form a connected series and body of truths agreeably to
the reason of all these things, that by clear and necessary statements
he may ascertain the truth regarding each individual
topic, and form, as we have said, one body of doctrine, by
means of illustrations and arguments,—either those which he
has discovered in holy Scripture, or which he has deduced by
closely tracing out the consequences and following a correct
method.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>
  <h3 id='de-principiis-book-1' class='c001'>BOOK <abbr title='one'>I.</abbr></h3>
</div>
<h4 id='de-principiis-b1-c1' class='c009'>CHAPTER <abbr title='one'>I.</abbr> <br> ON GOD.</h4>
<p class='c005'>1. I know that some will attempt to say that, even
according to the declarations of our own Scriptures,
God is a body, because in the writings
of Moses they find it said, that “our God is a
consuming fire;”<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c007'><sup>[19]</sup></a> and in the Gospel according to John,
that “God is a Spirit, and they who worship Him must
worship Him in spirit and in truth.”<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c007'><sup>[20]</sup></a> Fire and spirit,
according to them, are to be regarded as nothing else than
a body. Now, I should like to ask these persons what they
have to say respecting that passage where it is declared that
God is light; as John writes in his epistle, “God is light,
and in Him there is no darkness at all.”<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c007'><sup>[21]</sup></a> Truly He is that
light which illuminates the whole understanding of those
who are capable of receiving truth, as is said in the thirty-sixth
Psalm, “In Thy light we shall see light.”<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c007'><sup>[22]</sup></a> For what
other light of God can be named, “in which any one sees
light,” save an influence of God, by which a man, being
enlightened, either thoroughly sees the truth of all things,
or comes to know God Himself, who is called the truth?
Such is the meaning of the expression, “In Thy light we
shall see light;” <i>i.e.</i> in Thy word and wisdom, which is Thy
Son, in Himself we shall see Thee the Father. Because He
is called light, shall He be supposed to have any resemblance
to the light of the sun? Or how should there be the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>slightest ground for imagining, that from that corporeal
light any one could derive the cause of knowledge, and come
to the understanding of the truth?</p>

<p class='c006'>2. If, then, they acquiesce in our assertion, which reason
itself has demonstrated, regarding the nature of light, and
acknowledge that God cannot be understood to be a body in
the sense that light is, similar reasoning will hold true of the
expression “a consuming fire.” For what will God consume
in respect of His being fire? Shall He be thought to
consume material substance, as wood, or hay, or stubble?
And what in this view can be called worthy of the glory of
God, if He be a fire, consuming materials of that kind?
But let us reflect that God does indeed consume and utterly
destroy; that He consumes evil thoughts, wicked actions,
and sinful desires, when they find their way into the minds
of believers; and that, inhabiting along with His Son those
souls which are rendered capable of receiving His word and
wisdom, according to His own declaration, “I and the
Father shall come, and we shall make our abode with him,”<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c007'><sup>[23]</sup></a>
He makes them, after all their vices and passions have been
consumed, a holy temple, worthy of Himself. Those, moreover,
who, on account of the expression “God is a Spirit,”
think that He is a body, are to be answered, I think, in the
following manner. It is the custom of sacred Scripture,
when it wishes to designate anything opposed to this gross
and solid body, to call it spirit, as in the expression, “The
letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life,”<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c007'><sup>[24]</sup></a> where there can be
no doubt that by “letter” are meant bodily things, and by
“spirit” intellectual things, which we also term “spiritual.”
The apostle, moreover, says, “Even unto this day, when
Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart: nevertheless,
when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away:
and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.”<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c007'><sup>[25]</sup></a> For
so long as any one is not converted to a spiritual understanding,
a veil is placed over his heart, with which veil, <i>i.e.</i> a
gross understanding, Scripture itself is said or thought to be
covered: and this is the meaning of the statement that a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>veil was placed over the countenance of Moses when he
spoke to the people, <i>i.e.</i> when the law was publicly read
aloud. But if we turn to the Lord, where also is the word
of God, and where the Holy Spirit reveals spiritual knowledge,
then the veil is taken away, and with unveiled face
we shall behold the glory of the Lord in the holy Scriptures.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. And since many saints participate in the Holy Spirit,
He cannot therefore be understood to be a body, which being
divided into corporeal parts, is partaken of by each one of
the saints; but He is manifestly a sanctifying power, in
which all are said to have a share who have deserved to be
sanctified by His grace. And in order that what we say
may be more easily understood, let us take an illustration
from things very dissimilar. There are many persons who
take a part in the science<a id='r26'></a><a href='#f26' class='c007'><sup>[26]</sup></a> or art of medicine: are we therefore
to suppose that those who do so take to themselves the
particles of some body called medicine, which is placed
before them, and in this way participate in the same? Or
must we not rather understand that all who with quick and
trained minds come to understand the art and discipline
itself, may be said to be partakers of the art of healing?
But these are not to be deemed altogether parallel instances
in a comparison of medicine to the Holy Spirit, as they
have been adduced only to establish that that is not necessarily
to be considered a body, a share in which is possessed
by many individuals. For the Holy Spirit differs widely
from the method or science of medicine, in respect that the
Holy Spirit is an intellectual existence,<a id='r27'></a><a href='#f27' class='c007'><sup>[27]</sup></a> and subsists and
exists in a peculiar manner, whereas medicine is not at all of
that nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. But we must pass on to the language of the Gospel
itself, in which it is declared that “God is a Spirit,” and
where we have to show how that is to be understood agreeably
to what we have stated. For let us inquire on what occasion
these words were spoken by the Saviour, before whom He
uttered them, and what was the subject of investigation.
We find, without any doubt, that He spoke these words to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>the Samaritan woman, saying to her, who thought, agreeably
to the Samaritan view, that God ought to be worshipped on
Mount Gerizim, that “God is a Spirit.” For the Samaritan
woman, believing Him to be a Jew, was inquiring of Him
whether God ought to be worshipped in Jerusalem or on
this mountain; and her words were, “All our fathers worshipped
on this mountain, and ye say that in Jerusalem is
the place where we ought to worship.”<a id='r28'></a><a href='#f28' class='c007'><sup>[28]</sup></a> To this opinion of
the Samaritan woman, therefore, who imagined that God was
less rightly or duly worshipped, according to the privileges of
the different localities, either by the Jews in Jerusalem or
by the Samaritans on Mount Gerizim, the Saviour answered
that he who would follow the Lord must lay aside all preference
for particular places, and thus expressed Himself:
“The hour is coming when neither in Jerusalem nor
on this mountain shall the true worshippers worship the
Father. God is a Spirit, and they who worship Him must
worship Him in spirit and in truth.”<a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c007'><sup>[29]</sup></a> And observe how
logically He has joined together the spirit and the truth:
He called God a Spirit, that He might distinguish Him from
bodies; and He named Him the truth, to distinguish Him
from a shadow or an image. For they who worshipped in
Jerusalem worshipped God neither in truth nor in spirit,
being in subjection to the shadow or image of heavenly
things; and such also was the case with those who worshipped
on Mount Gerizim.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. Having refuted, then, as well as we could, every notion
which might suggest that we were to think of God as in any
degree corporeal, we go on to say that, according to strict
truth, God is incomprehensible, and incapable of being
measured.<a id='r30'></a><a href='#f30' class='c007'><sup>[30]</sup></a> For whatever be the knowledge which we are
able to obtain of God, either by perception or reflection, we
must of necessity believe that He is by many degrees far
better than what we perceive Him to be. For, as if we were
to see any one unable to bear a spark of light, or the flame
of a very small lamp, and were desirous to acquaint such
a one, whose vision could not admit a greater degree of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>light than what we have stated, with the brightness and
splendour of the sun, would it not be necessary to tell him
that the splendour of the sun was unspeakably and incalculably
better and more glorious than all this light which
he saw? So our understanding, when shut in by the fetters
of flesh and blood, and rendered, on account of its participation
in such material substances, duller and more obtuse,
although, in comparison with our bodily nature, it is esteemed
to be far superior, yet, in its efforts to examine and behold
incorporeal things, scarcely holds the place of a spark or
lamp. But among all intelligent, that is, incorporeal beings,
what is so superior to all others—so unspeakably and incalculably
superior—as God, whose nature cannot be grasped
or seen by the power of any human understanding, even the
purest and brightest?</p>

<p class='c006'>6. But it will not appear absurd if we employ another
similitude to make the matter clearer. Our eyes frequently
cannot look upon the nature of the light itself—that is, upon
the substance of the sun; but when we behold his splendour
or his rays pouring in, perhaps, through windows or some
small openings to admit the light, we can reflect how great
is the supply and source of the light of the body. So, in
like manner, the works of Divine Providence and the plan
of this whole world are a sort of rays, as it were, of the
nature of God, in comparison with His real substance and
being. As, therefore, our understanding is unable of itself
to behold God Himself as He is, it knows the Father of
the world from the beauty of His works and the comeliness
of His creatures. God, therefore, is not to be thought of as
being either a body or as existing in a body, but as an uncompounded
intellectual nature,<a id='r31'></a><a href='#f31' class='c007'><sup>[31]</sup></a> admitting within Himself
no addition of any kind; so that He cannot be believed to
have within Him a greater and a less, but is such that He is
in all parts Μονάς, and, so to speak, Ἑνάς, and is the mind
and source from which all intellectual nature or mind takes its
beginning. But mind, for its movements or operations, needs
no physical space, nor sensible magnitude, nor bodily shape,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>nor colour, nor any other of those adjuncts which are the properties
of body or matter. Wherefore that simple and wholly
intellectual nature<a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c007'><sup>[32]</sup></a> can admit of no delay or hesitation in its
movements or operations, lest the simplicity of the divine
nature should appear to be circumscribed or in some degree
hampered by such adjuncts, and lest that which is the beginning
of all things should be found composite and differing,
and that which ought to be free from all bodily intermixture,
in virtue of being the one sole species of Deity, so to speak,
should prove, instead of being one, to consist of many things.
That mind, moreover, does not require space in order to carry
on its movements agreeably to its nature, is certain from
observation of our own mind. For if the mind abide within
its own limits, and sustain no injury from any cause, it will
never, from diversity of situation, be retarded in the discharge
of its functions; nor, on the other hand, does it gain any
addition or increase of mobility from the nature of particular
places. And here, if any one were to object, for example,
that among those who are at sea, and tossed by its waves, the
mind is considerably less vigorous than it is wont to be on land,
we are to believe that it is in this state, not from diversity of
situation, but from the commotion or disturbance of the body
to which the mind is joined or attached. For it seems to be
contrary to nature, as it were, for a human body to live at
sea; and for that reason it appears, by a sort of inequality of
its own, to enter upon its mental operations in a slovenly and
irregular manner, and to perform the acts of the intellect
with a duller sense, in as great degree as those who on land
are prostrated with fever; with respect to whom it is certain,
that if the mind do not discharge its functions as well as
before, in consequence of the attack of disease, the blame is
to be laid not upon the place, but upon the bodily malady, by
which the body, being disturbed and disordered, renders to
the mind its customary services under by no means the well-known
and natural conditions: for we human beings are
animals composed of a union of body and soul, and in this way
[only] was it possible for us to live upon the earth. But God,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>who is the beginning of all things, is not to be regarded as
a composite being, lest perchance there should be found to
exist elements prior to the beginning itself, out of which
everything is composed, whatever that be which is called
composite. Neither does the mind require bodily magnitude
in order to perform any act or movement; as when the eye
by gazing upon bodies of larger size is dilated, but is compressed
and contracted in order to see smaller objects. The
mind, indeed, requires magnitude of an intellectual kind,
because it grows, not after the fashion of a body, but after that
of intelligence. For the mind is not enlarged, together with
the body, by means of corporal additions, up to the twentieth
or thirtieth year of life; but the intellect is sharpened by exercises
of learning, and the powers implanted within it for intelligent
purposes are called forth; and it is rendered capable
of greater intellectual efforts, not being increased by bodily
additions, but carefully polished by learned exercises. But
these it cannot receive immediately from boyhood, or from
birth, because the framework of limbs which the mind employs
as organs for exercising itself is weak and feeble; and it is
unable to bear the weight of its own operations, or to exhibit
a capacity for receiving training.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. If there are any now who think that the mind itself
and the soul is a body, I wish they would tell me by way of
answer how it receives reasons and assertions on subjects
of such importance—of such difficulty and such subtlety?
Whence does it derive the power of memory? and whence
comes the contemplation of invisible<a id='r33'></a><a href='#f33' class='c007'><sup>[33]</sup></a> things? How does the
body possess the faculty of understanding incorporeal existences?
How does a bodily nature investigate the processes
of the various arts, and contemplate the reasons of things?
How, also, is it able to perceive and understand divine truths,
which are manifestly incorporeal? Unless, indeed, some
should happen to be of opinion, that as the very bodily shape
and form of the ears or eyes contributes something to hearing
and to sight, and as the individual members, formed by God,
have some adaptation, even from the very quality of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>form, to the end for which they were naturally appointed;
so also he may think that the shape of the soul or mind is to
be understood as if created purposely and designedly for perceiving
and understanding individual things, and for being
set in motion by vital movements. I do not perceive, however,
who shall be able to describe or state what is the colour
of the mind, in respect of its being mind, and acting as an
intelligent existence. Moreover, in confirmation and explanation
of what we have already advanced regarding the
mind or soul—to the effect that it is better than the whole
bodily nature—the following remarks may be added. There
underlies every bodily sense a certain peculiar sensible substance,<a id='r34'></a><a href='#f34' class='c007'><sup>[34]</sup></a>
on which the bodily sense exerts itself. For example,
colours, form, size, underlie vision; voices and sound, the
sense of hearing; odours, good or bad, that of smell; savours,
that of taste; heat or cold, hardness or softness, roughness or
smoothness, that of touch. Now, of those senses enumerated
above, it is manifest to all that the sense of mind is much the
best. How, then, should it not appear absurd, that under
those senses which are inferior, substances should have been
placed on which to exert their powers, but that under this
power, which is far better than any other, <i>i.e.</i> the sense of
mind, nothing at all of the nature of a substance should be
placed, but that a power of an intellectual nature should be
an accident, or consequent upon bodies? Those who assert
this, doubtless do so to the disparagement of that better substance
which is within them; nay, by so doing, they even do
wrong to God Himself, when they imagine He may be understood
by means of a bodily nature, so that according to their
view He is a body, and that which may be understood or
perceived by means of a body; and they are unwilling to
have it understood that the mind bears a certain relationship
to God, of whom the mind itself is an intellectual image, and
that by means of this it may come to some knowledge of the
nature of divinity, especially if it be purified and separated
from bodily matter.</p>

<p class='c006'>8. But perhaps these declarations may seem to have less
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>weight with those who wish to be instructed in divine things
out of the holy Scriptures, and who seek to have it proved
to them from that source how the nature of God surpasses
the nature of bodies. See, therefore, if the apostle does not
say the same thing, when, speaking of Christ, he declares,
that “He is the image of the invisible God, the first-born
of every creature.”<a id='r35'></a><a href='#f35' class='c007'><sup>[35]</sup></a> Not, as some suppose, that the nature
of God is visible to some and invisible to others: for the
apostle does not say “the image of God invisible” to men or
“invisible” to sinners, but with unvarying constancy pronounces
on the nature of God in these words: “the image
of the invisible God.” Moreover, John in his Gospel, when
asserting that “no one hath seen God at any time,”<a id='r36'></a><a href='#f36' class='c007'><sup>[36]</sup></a> manifestly
declares to all who are capable of understanding, that
there is no nature to which God is visible: not as if He were
a being who was visible by nature, and merely escaped or
baffled the view of a frailer creature, but because by the
<i>nature</i> of His being it is impossible for Him to be seen.
And if you should ask of me what is my opinion regarding
the Only-begotten Himself, whether the nature of God, which
is naturally invisible, be not visible even to Him, let not such
a question appear to you at once to be either absurd or impious,
because we shall give you a logical reason. It is one
thing to see, and another to know: to see and to be seen is a
property of bodies; to know and to be known, an attribute of
intellectual being. Whatever, therefore, is a property of
bodies, cannot be predicated either of the Father or of the
Son; but what belongs to the nature of deity is common to
the Father and the Son.<a id='r37'></a><a href='#f37' class='c007'><sup>[37]</sup></a> Finally, even He Himself, in the
Gospel, did not say that no one has <i>seen</i> the Father, save the
Son, nor any one the Son, save the Father; but His words
are: “No one <i>knoweth</i> the Son, save the Father; nor any
one the Father, save the Son.”<a id='r38'></a><a href='#f38' class='c007'><sup>[38]</sup></a> By which it is clearly shown,
that whatever among bodily natures is called seeing and being
seen, is termed, between the Father and the Son, a knowing
and being known, by means of the power of knowledge, not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>by the frailness of the sense of sight. Because, then, neither
seeing nor being seen can be properly applied to an incorporeal
and invisible nature, neither is the Father, in the
Gospel, said to be seen by the Son, nor the Son by the Father,
but the one is said to be known by the other.</p>

<p class='c006'>9. Here, if any one lay before us the passage where it
is said, “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall
see God,”<a id='r39'></a><a href='#f39' class='c007'><sup>[39]</sup></a> from that very passage, in my opinion, will our
position derive additional strength; for what else is seeing
God in heart, but, according to our exposition as above,
understanding and knowing Him with the mind? For the
names of the organs of sense are frequently applied to the
soul, so that it may be said to see with the eyes of the heart,
<i>i.e.</i> to perform an intellectual act by means of the power of
intelligence. So also it is said to hear with the ears when it
perceives the deeper meaning of a statement. So also we say
that it makes use of teeth, when it chews and eats the bread
of life which cometh down from heaven. In like manner,
also, it is said to employ the services of other members, which
are transferred from their bodily appellations, and applied to
the powers of the soul, according to the words of Solomon,
“You will find a divine sense.”<a id='r40'></a><a href='#f40' class='c007'><sup>[40]</sup></a> For he knew that there
were within us two kinds of senses: the one mortal, corruptible,
human; the other immortal and intellectual, which he
now termed divine. By this divine sense, therefore, not of
the eyes, but of a pure heart, which is the mind, God may be
seen by those who are worthy. For you will certainly find
in all the Scriptures, both old and new, the term “heart”
repeatedly used instead of “mind,” <i>i.e.</i> intellectual power.
In this manner, therefore, although far below the dignity of
the subject, have we spoken of the nature of God, as those
who understand it under the limitation of the human understanding.
In the next place, let us see what is meant by the
name of Christ.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>
  <h4 id='de-principiis-b1-c2' class='c010'>CHAPTER <abbr title='two'>II.</abbr> <br> ON CHRIST.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c005'>1. In the first place, we must note that the nature of that
deity which is in Christ in respect of His being the only-begotten
Son of God is one thing, and that human nature which
He assumed in these last times for the purposes of the dispensation
[of grace] is another. And therefore we have first
to ascertain what the only-begotten Son of God is, seeing He
is called by many different names, according to the circumstances
and views of individuals. For He is termed Wisdom,
according to the expression of Solomon: “The Lord created
me—the beginning of His ways, and among His works,
before He made any other thing; He founded me before the
ages. In the beginning, before He formed the earth, before
He brought forth the fountains of waters, before the mountains
were made strong, before all the hills, He brought me
forth.”<a id='r41'></a><a href='#f41' class='c007'><sup>[41]</sup></a> He is also styled First-born, as the apostle has
declared: “who is the first-born of every creature.”<a id='r42'></a><a href='#f42' class='c007'><sup>[42]</sup></a> The
first-born, however, is not by nature a different person from
the Wisdom, but one and the same. Finally, the Apostle
Paul says that “Christ [is] the power of God and the wisdom
of God.”<a id='r43'></a><a href='#f43' class='c007'><sup>[43]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>2. Let no one, however, imagine that we mean anything
impersonal<a id='r44'></a><a href='#f44' class='c007'><sup>[44]</sup></a> when we call Him the wisdom of God; or
suppose, for example, that we understand Him to be, not a
living being endowed with wisdom, but something which
makes men wise, giving itself to, and implanting itself in, the
minds of those who are made capable of receiving His virtues
and intelligence. If, then, it is once rightly understood that
the only-begotten Son of God is His wisdom hypostatically<a id='r45'></a><a href='#f45' class='c007'><sup>[45]</sup></a>
existing, I know not whether our curiosity ought to advance
beyond this, or entertain any suspicion that that <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑπόστασις</span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>substantia</i></span> contains anything of a bodily nature, since
everything that is corporeal is distinguished either by form,
or colour, or magnitude. And who in his sound senses ever
sought for form, or colour, or size, in wisdom, in respect of
its being wisdom? And who that is capable of entertaining
reverential thoughts or feelings regarding God, can suppose
or believe that God the Father ever existed, even for a
moment of time,<a id='r46'></a><a href='#f46' class='c007'><sup>[46]</sup></a> without having generated this Wisdom?
For in that case he must say either that God was unable to
generate Wisdom before He produced her, so that He afterwards
called into being her who formerly did not exist, or
that He possessed the power indeed, but—what cannot be
said of God without impiety—was unwilling to use it; both
of which suppositions, it is patent to all, are alike absurd and
impious: for they amount to this, either that God advanced
from a condition of inability to one of ability, or that, although
possessed of the power, He concealed it, and delayed the
generation of Wisdom. Wherefore we have always held
that God is the Father of His only-begotten Son, who was
born indeed of Him, and derives from Him what He is, but
without any beginning, not only such as may be measured by
any divisions of time, but even that which the mind alone
can contemplate within itself, or behold, so to speak, with
the naked powers of the understanding. And therefore we
must believe that Wisdom was generated before any beginning
that can be either comprehended or expressed. And since
all the creative power of the coming creation<a id='r47'></a><a href='#f47' class='c007'><sup>[47]</sup></a> was included
in this very existence of Wisdom (whether of those things
which have an original or of those which have a derived
existence), having been formed beforehand and arranged by
the power of foreknowledge; on account of these very
creatures which had been described, as it were, and prefigured
in Wisdom herself, does Wisdom say, in the words
of Solomon, that she was created the beginning of the ways
of God, inasmuch as she contained within herself either the
beginnings, or forms, or species of all creation.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>3. Now, in the same way in which we have understood
that Wisdom was the beginning of the ways of God, and is
said to be created, forming beforehand and containing within
herself the species and beginnings of all creatures, must we
understand her to be the Word of God, because of her disclosing
to all other beings, <i>i.e.</i> to universal creation, the
nature of the mysteries and secrets which are contained
within the divine wisdom; and on this account she is called
the Word, because she is, as it were, the interpreter of the
secrets of the mind. And therefore that language which
is found in the <i>Acts of Paul</i>,<a id='r48'></a><a href='#f48' class='c007'><sup>[48]</sup></a> where it is said that “here is
the Word a living being,” appears to me to be rightly used.
John, however, with more sublimity and propriety, says in
the beginning of his Gospel, when defining God by a special
definition to be the Word, “And God was the Word,<a id='r49'></a><a href='#f49' class='c007'><sup>[49]</sup></a> and
this was in the beginning with God.” Let him, then, who
assigns a beginning to the Word or Wisdom of God, take care
that he be not guilty of impiety against the unbegotten
Father Himself, seeing he denies that He had always been
a Father, and had generated the Word, and had possessed
wisdom in all preceding periods, whether they be called times
or ages, or anything else that can be so entitled.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. This Son, accordingly, is also the truth and life of all
things which exist. And with reason. For how could those
things which were created live, unless they derived their
being from life? or how could those things which are,
truly exist, unless they came down from the truth? or how
could rational beings exist, unless the Word or reason had
previously existed? or how could they be wise, unless there
were wisdom? But since it was to come to pass that some
also should fall away from life, and bring death upon themselves
by their declension—for death is nothing else than a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>departure from life—and as it was not to follow that those
beings which had once been created by God for the enjoyment
of life should utterly perish, it was necessary that,
before death, there should be in existence such a power as
would destroy the coming death, and that there should be a
resurrection, the type of which was in our Lord and Saviour,
and that this resurrection should have its ground in the
wisdom and word and life of God. And then, in the next
place, since some of those who were created were not to be
always willing to remain unchangeable and unalterable in
the calm and moderate enjoyment of the blessings which they
possessed, but, in consequence of the good which was in
them being theirs not by nature or essence, but by accident,
were to be perverted and changed, and to fall away from
their position, therefore was the Word and Wisdom of God
made the Way. And it was so termed because it leads to the
Father those who walk along it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Whatever, therefore, we have predicated of the wisdom of
God, will be appropriately applied and understood of the Son
of God, in virtue of His being the Life, and the Word, and
the Truth, and the Resurrection: for all these titles are
derived from His power and operations, and in none of them
is there the slightest ground for understanding anything of a
corporeal nature which might seem to denote either size, or
form, or colour; for those children of men which appear
among us, or those descendants of other living beings, correspond
to the seed of those by whom they were begotten,
or derive from those mothers, in whose wombs they are
formed and nourished, whatever that is, which they bring
into this life, and carry with them when they are born.<a id='r50'></a><a href='#f50' class='c007'><sup>[50]</sup></a> But
it is monstrous and unlawful to compare God the Father, in
the generation of His only-begotten Son, and in the substance<a id='r51'></a><a href='#f51' class='c007'><sup>[51]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>of the same, to any man or other living thing engaged
in such an act; for we must of necessity hold that there is
something exceptional and worthy of God which does not
admit of any comparison at all, not merely in things, but
which cannot even be conceived by thought or discovered
by perception, so that a human mind should be able to apprehend
how the unbegotten God is made the Father of the
only-begotten Son. Because His generation is as eternal
and everlasting as the brilliancy which is produced from the
sun. For it is not by receiving the<a id='r52'></a><a href='#f52' class='c007'><sup>[52]</sup></a> breath of life that He
is made a Son, by <i>any outward act</i>, but by His own nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. Let us now ascertain how those statements which we
have advanced are supported by the authority of holy Scripture.
The Apostle Paul says, that the only-begotten Son is
the “image of the invisible God,” and “the first-born of
every creature.”<a id='r53'></a><a href='#f53' class='c007'><sup>[53]</sup></a> And when writing to the Hebrews, he
says of Him that He is “the brightness of His glory, and
the express image of His person.”<a id='r54'></a><a href='#f54' class='c007'><sup>[54]</sup></a> Now, we find in the
treatise called the Wisdom of Solomon the following description
of the wisdom of God: “For she is the breath of the
power of God, and the purest efflux<a id='r55'></a><a href='#f55' class='c007'><sup>[55]</sup></a> of the glory of the
Almighty.”<a id='r56'></a><a href='#f56' class='c007'><sup>[56]</sup></a> Nothing that is polluted can therefore come
upon her. For she is the splendour of the eternal light, and
the stainless mirror of God’s working, and the image of His
goodness. Now we say, as before, that Wisdom has her existence
nowhere else save in Him who is the beginning of all
things: from whom also is derived everything that is wise,
because He Himself is the only one who is by nature a Son,
and is therefore termed the Only-begotten.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. Let us now see how we are to understand the expression
“invisible image,” that we may in this way perceive
how God is rightly called the Father of His Son; and let
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>us, in the first place, draw our conclusions from what are
customarily called images among men. That is sometimes
called an image which is painted or sculptured on some material
substance, such as wood or stone; and sometimes a
child is called the image of his parent, when the features of
the child in no respect belie their resemblance to the father.
I think, therefore, that that man who was formed after the
image and likeness of God may be fittingly compared to the
first illustration. Respecting him, however, we shall see more
precisely, God willing, when we come to expound the passage
in Genesis. But the image of the Son of God, of whom we
are now speaking, may be compared to the second of the
above examples, even in respect of this, that He is the invisible
image of the invisible God, in the same manner as we
say, according to the sacred history, that the image of Adam
is his son Seth. The words are, “And Adam begat Seth in
his own likeness, and after his own image.”<a id='r57'></a><a href='#f57' class='c007'><sup>[57]</sup></a> Now this
image contains the unity of nature and substance belonging
to Father and Son. For if the Son do, in like manner, all
those things which the Father doth, then, in virtue of the
Son doing all things like the Father, is the image of the
Father formed in the Son, who is born of Him, like an act
of His will proceeding from the mind. And I am therefore
of opinion that the will of the Father ought alone to be sufficient
for the existence of that which He wishes to exist. For
in the exercise of His will He employs no other way than
that which is made known by the counsel of His will. And
thus also the existence<a id='r58'></a><a href='#f58' class='c007'><sup>[58]</sup></a> of the Son is generated by Him.
For this point must above all others be maintained by those
who allow nothing to be unbegotten, <i>i.e.</i> unborn, save God
the Father only. And we must be careful not to fall into
the absurdities of those who picture to themselves certain
emanations, so as to divide the divine nature into parts, and
who divide God the Father as far as they can, since even to
entertain the remotest suspicion of such a thing regarding
an incorporeal being is not only the height of impiety, but a
mark of the greatest folly, it being most remote from any intelligent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>conception that there should be any physical division
of any incorporeal nature. Rather, therefore, as an act of the
will proceeds from the understanding, and neither cuts off any
part nor is separated or divided from it, so after some such
fashion is the Father to be supposed as having begotten the
Son, His own image; namely, so that, as He is Himself invisible
by nature, He also begat an image that was invisible.
For the Son is the Word, and therefore we are not to understand
that anything in Him is cognisable by the senses.
He is wisdom, and in wisdom there can be no suspicion of
anything corporeal. He is the true light, which enlightens
every man that cometh into this world; but He has nothing
in common with the light of this sun. Our Saviour, therefore,
is the image of the invisible God, inasmuch as compared
with the Father Himself He is the truth: and as compared
with us, to whom He reveals the Father, He is the image
by which we come to the knowledge of the Father, whom no
one knows save the Son, and he to whom the Son is pleased
to reveal Him. And the method of revealing Him is through
the understanding. For He by whom the Son Himself is
understood, understands, as a consequence, the Father also,
according to His own words: “He that hath seen me, hath
seen the Father also.”<a id='r59'></a><a href='#f59' class='c007'><sup>[59]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>7. But since we quoted the language of Paul regarding
Christ, where he says of Him that He is “the brightness
of the glory of God, and the express figure of his person,”<a id='r60'></a><a href='#f60' class='c007'><sup>[60]</sup></a>
let us see what idea we are to form of this. According to
John, “God is light.” The only-begotten Son, therefore, is
the glory of this light, proceeding inseparably from [God]
Himself, as brightness does from light, and illuminating the
whole of creation. For, agreeably to what we have already
explained as to the manner in which He is the Way, and
conducts to the Father; and in which He is the Word,
interpreting the secrets of wisdom, and the mysteries of
knowledge, making them known to the rational creation;
and is also the Truth, and the Life, and the Resurrection,—in
the same way ought we to understand also the meaning of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>His being the brightness: for it is by its splendour that we
understand and feel what light itself is. And this splendour,
presenting itself gently and softly to the frail and weak eyes
of mortals, and gradually training, as it were, and accustoming
them to bear the brightness of the light, when it has put
away from them every hindrance and obstruction to vision,
according to the Lord’s own precept, “Cast forth the beam
out of thine eye,”<a id='r61'></a><a href='#f61' class='c007'><sup>[61]</sup></a> renders them capable of enduring the
splendour of the light, being made in this respect also a sort
of mediator between men and the light.</p>

<p class='c006'>8. But since He is called by the apostle not only the
brightness of His glory, but also the express figure of His
person or <i>subsistence</i>,<a id='r62'></a><a href='#f62' class='c007'><sup>[62]</sup></a> it does not seem idle to inquire how
there can be said to be another figure of that person besides
the person of God Himself, whatever be the meaning of
person and subsistence. Consider, then, whether the Son of
God, seeing He is His Word and Wisdom, and alone knows
the Father, and reveals Him to whom He will (<i>i.e.</i> to those
who are capable of receiving His word and wisdom), may not,
in regard of this very point of making God to be understood
and acknowledged, be called the figure of His person and
subsistence; that is, when that Wisdom, which desires to
make known to others the means by which God is acknowledged
and understood by them, describes Himself first of all,
it may by so doing be called the express figure of the person
of God. In order, however, to arrive at a fuller understanding
of the manner in which the Saviour is the figure of the
person or subsistence of God, let us take an instance, which,
although it does not describe the subject of which we are
treating either fully or appropriately, may nevertheless be
seen to be employed for this purpose only, to show that the
Son of God, who was in the form of God, divesting Himself
[of His glory], makes it His object, by this very divesting of
Himself, to demonstrate to us the fulness of His deity. For
instance, suppose that there were a statue of so enormous a
size as to fill the whole world, and which on that account
could be seen by no one; and that another statue were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>formed altogether resembling it in the shape of the limbs,
and in the features of the countenance, and in form and
material, but without the same immensity of size, so that
those who were unable to behold the one of enormous proportions,
should, on seeing the latter, acknowledge that they
had seen the former, because it preserved all the features
of its limbs and countenance, and even the very form and
material, so closely, as to be altogether undistinguishable
from it; by some such similitude, the Son of God, divesting
Himself of His equality with the Father, and showing to us
the way to the knowledge of Him, is made the express image
of His person: so that we, who were unable to look upon
the glory of that marvellous light when placed in the greatness
of His Godhead, may, by His being made to us brightness,
obtain the means of beholding the divine light by
looking upon the brightness. This comparison, of course, of
statues, as belonging to material things, is employed for no
other purpose than to show that the Son of God, though
placed in the very insignificant form of a human body, in
consequence of the resemblance of His works and power to
the Father, showed that there was in Him an immense and
invisible greatness, inasmuch as He said to His disciples,
“He who sees me, sees the Father also;” and, “I and the
Father are one.” And to these belong also the similar expression,
“The Father is in me, and I in the Father.”</p>

<p class='c006'>9. Let us see now what is the meaning of the expression
which is found in the Wisdom of Solomon, where it is said
of Wisdom that “it is a kind of breath of the power of God,
and the purest efflux of the glory of the Omnipotent, and the
splendour of eternal light, and the spotless mirror of the
working or power of God, and the image of His goodness.”<a id='r63'></a><a href='#f63' class='c007'><sup>[63]</sup></a>
These, then, are the definitions which He gives of God,
pointing out by each one of them certain attributes which
belong to the Wisdom of God, calling wisdom the power,
and the glory, and the everlasting light, and the working,
and the goodness of God. He does not say, however, that
wisdom is the breath of the glory of the Almighty, nor of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>the everlasting light, nor of the working of the Father, nor
of His goodness, for it was not appropriate that breath should
be ascribed to any one of these; but, with all propriety, he
says that wisdom is the breath of the power of God. Now,
by the power of God is to be understood that by which He
is strong; by which He appoints, restrains, and governs all
things visible and invisible; which is sufficient for all those
things which He rules over in His providence; among all
which He is present, as if one individual. And although
the breath of all this mighty and immeasurable power, and
the vigour itself produced, so to speak, by its own existence,
proceed from the power itself, as the will does from the mind,
yet even this will of God is nevertheless made to become the
power of God.<a id='r64'></a><a href='#f64' class='c007'><sup>[64]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Another power accordingly is produced, which exists with
properties of its own,—a kind of breath, as Scripture says, of
the primal and unbegotten power of God, deriving from Him
its being, and never at any time non-existent. For if any
one were to assert that it did not formerly exist, but came
afterwards into existence, let him explain the reason why the
Father, who gave it being, did not do so before. And if he
shall grant that there was once a beginning, when that breath
proceeded from the power of God, we shall ask him again,
why not even before the beginning, which he has allowed;
and in this way, ever demanding an earlier date, and going
upwards with our interrogations, we shall arrive at this conclusion,
that as God was always possessed of power and will,
there never was any reason of propriety or otherwise, why
He may not have always possessed that blessing which He
desired. By which it is shown that that breath of God’s
power always existed, having no beginning save God Himself.
Nor was it fitting that there should be any other
beginning save God Himself, from whom it derives its birth.
And according to the expression of the apostle, that Christ
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>“is the power of God,”<a id='r65'></a><a href='#f65' class='c007'><sup>[65]</sup></a> it ought to be termed not only the
breath of the power of God, but power out of power.</p>

<p class='c006'>10. Let us now examine the expression, “Wisdom is the
purest efflux of the glory of the Almighty;” and let us first
consider what the glory of the omnipotent God is, and then
we shall also understand what is its efflux. As no one can
be a father without having a son, nor a master without possessing
a servant, so even God cannot be called omnipotent
unless there exist those over whom He may exercise His
power; and therefore, that God may be shown to be almighty,
it is necessary that all things should exist. For if any one
would have some ages or portions of time, or whatever else
he likes to call them, to have passed away, while those things
which were afterwards made did not yet exist, he would undoubtedly
show that during those ages or periods God was
not omnipotent, but became so afterwards, viz. from the time
that He began to have persons over whom to exercise power;
and in this way He will appear to have received a certain
increase, and to have risen from a lower to a higher condition;
since there can be no doubt that it is better for Him
to be omnipotent than not to be so. And now how can
it appear otherwise than absurd, that when God possessed
none of those things which it was befitting for Him to possess,
He should afterwards, by a kind of progress, come into the
possession of them? But if there never was a time when
He was not omnipotent, of necessity those things by which He
receives that title must also exist; and He must always have
had those over whom He exercised power, and which were
governed by Him either as king or prince, of which we shall
speak more fully in the proper place, when we come to discuss
the subject of the creatures. But even now I think it
necessary to drop a word, although cursorily, of warning,
since the question before us is, how wisdom is the purest
efflux of the glory of the Almighty, lest any one should think
that the title of Omnipotent was anterior in God to the birth
of Wisdom, through whom He is called Father, seeing that
Wisdom, which is the Son of God, is the purest efflux of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>glory of the Almighty. Let him who is inclined to entertain
this suspicion hear the undoubted declaration of Scripture
pronouncing, “In wisdom hast Thou made them all,”<a id='r66'></a><a href='#f66' class='c007'><sup>[66]</sup></a> and
the teaching of the gospel, that “by Him were all things
made, and without Him nothing was made;”<a id='r67'></a><a href='#f67' class='c007'><sup>[67]</sup></a> and let him
understand from this that the title of Omnipotent in God
cannot be older than that of Father; for it is through the
Son that the Father is almighty. But from the expression
“glory of the Almighty,” of which glory Wisdom is the
efflux, this is to be understood, that Wisdom, through which
God is called Omnipotent, has a share in the glory of the
Almighty. For through Wisdom, which is Christ, God has
power over all things, not only by the authority of a ruler,
but also by the voluntary obedience of subjects. And that
you may understand that the omnipotence of Father and Son
is one and the same, as God and the Lord are one and the
same with the Father, listen to the manner in which John
speaks in the Apocalypse: “Thus saith the Lord God, which
is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.”<a id='r68'></a><a href='#f68' class='c007'><sup>[68]</sup></a> For
who else was “He which is to come” than Christ? And as
no one ought to be offended, seeing God is the Father, that
the Saviour is also God; so also, since the Father is called
omnipotent, no one ought to be offended that the Son of
God is also called omnipotent. For in this way will that
saying be true which He utters to the Father, “All mine are
Thine, and Thine are mine, and I am glorified in them.”<a id='r69'></a><a href='#f69' class='c007'><sup>[69]</sup></a>
Now, if all things which are the Father’s are also Christ’s,
certainly among those things which exist is the omnipotence
of the Father; and doubtless the only-begotten Son ought
to be omnipotent, that the Son also may have all things which
the Father possesses. “And I am glorified in them,” He
declares. For “at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow,
of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under
the earth; and every tongue shall confess that the Lord
Jesus is in the glory of God the Father.”<a id='r70'></a><a href='#f70' class='c007'><sup>[70]</sup></a> Therefore He
is the efflux of the glory of God in this respect, that He is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>omnipotent—the pure and limpid Wisdom herself—glorified
as the efflux of omnipotence or of glory. And that it may
be more clearly understood what the glory of omnipotence is,
we shall add the following. God the Father is omnipotent,
because He has power over all things, <i>i.e.</i> over heaven and
earth, sun, moon, and stars, and all things in them. And
He exercises His power over them by means of His Word,
because at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow, both of
things in heaven, and things on earth, and things under the
earth. And if every knee is bent to Jesus, then, without
doubt, it is Jesus to whom all things are subject, and He it
is who exercises power over all things, and through whom all
things are subject to the Father; for through wisdom, <i>i.e.</i>
by word and reason, not by force and necessity, are all things
subject. And therefore His glory consists in this very thing,
that He possesses all things, and this is the purest and most
limpid glory of omnipotence, that by reason and wisdom, not
by force and necessity, all things are subject. Now the
purest and most limpid glory of wisdom is a convenient
expression to distinguish it from that glory which cannot be
called pure and sincere. But every nature which is convertible
and changeable, although glorified in the works of
righteousness or wisdom, yet by the fact that righteousness
or wisdom are accidental qualities, and because that which is
accidental, may also fall away, its glory cannot be called
sincere and pure. But the Wisdom of God, which is His
only-begotten Son, being in all respects incapable of change
or alteration, and every good quality in Him being essential,
and such as cannot be changed and converted, His glory is
therefore declared to be pure and sincere.</p>

<p class='c006'>11. In the third place, wisdom is called the splendour of
eternal light. The force of this expression we have explained
in the preceding pages, when we introduced the similitude
of the sun and the splendour of its rays, and showed to the
best of our power how this should be understood. To what
we then said we shall add only the following remark. That
is properly termed everlasting or eternal which neither had a
beginning of existence, nor can ever cease to be what it is.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>And this is the idea conveyed by John when he says that
“God is Light.” Now His wisdom is the splendour of that
light, not only in respect of its being light, but also of being
everlasting light, so that His wisdom is eternal and everlasting
splendour. If this be fully understood, it clearly shows
that the existence of the Son is derived from the Father, but
not in time, nor from any other beginning, except, as we
have said, from God Himself.</p>

<p class='c006'>12. But wisdom is also called the stainless mirror of the
ἐνέργεια or working of God. We must first understand,
then, what the working of the power of God is. It is a sort
of vigour, so to speak, by which God operates either in creation,
or in providence, or in judgment, or in the disposal and
arrangement of individual things, each in its season. For as
the image formed in a mirror unerringly reflects all the acts
and movements of him who gazes on it, so would Wisdom
have herself to be understood when she is called the stainless
mirror of the power and working of the Father: as the Lord
Jesus Christ also, who is the Wisdom of God, declares of
Himself when He says, “The works which the Father doeth,
these also doeth the Son likewise.”<a id='r71'></a><a href='#f71' class='c007'><sup>[71]</sup></a> And again He says, that
the Son cannot do anything of Himself, save what He sees
the Father do. As therefore the Son in no respect differs
from the Father in the power of His works, and the work of
the Son is not a different thing from that of the Father, but
one and the same movement, so to speak, is in all things, He
therefore named Him a stainless mirror, that by such an expression
it might be understood that there is no dissimilarity
whatever between the Son and the Father. How, indeed,
can those things which are said by some to be done after the
manner in which a disciple resembles or imitates his master,
or according to the view that those things are made by the
Son in bodily material which were first formed by the Father
in their spiritual essence, agree with the declarations of Scripture,
seeing in the Gospel the Son is said to do not similar
things, but the <i>same</i> things in a similar manner?</p>

<p class='c006'>13. It remains that we inquire what is the “image of His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>goodness;” and here, I think, we must understand the same
thing which we expressed a little ago, in speaking of the
image formed by the mirror. For He is the primal goodness,
doubtless, out of which the Son is born, who, being in all respects
the image of the Father, may certainly also be called
with propriety the image of His goodness. For there is no
other second goodness existing in the Son, save that which
is in the Father. And therefore also the Saviour Himself
rightly says in the Gospel, “There is none good save one only,
God the Father,” that by such an expression it may be understood
that the Son is not of a different goodness, but of that
only which exists in the Father, of whom He is rightly termed
the image, because He proceeds from no other source but
from that primal goodness, lest there might appear to be in
the Son a different goodness from that which is in the Father.
Nor is there any dissimilarity or difference of goodness in the
Son. And therefore it is not to be imagined that there is a
kind of blasphemy, as it were, in the words, “There is none
good save one only, God the Father,” as if thereby it may
be supposed to be denied that either Christ or the Holy Spirit
was good. But, as we have already said, the primal goodness
is to be understood as residing in God the Father, from
whom both the Son is born and the Holy Spirit proceeds,
retaining within them, without any doubt, the nature of that
goodness which is in the source whence they are derived.
And if there be any other things which in Scripture are
called good, whether angel, or man, or servant, or treasure,
or a good heart, or a good tree, all these are so termed catachrestically,<a id='r72'></a><a href='#f72' class='c007'><sup>[72]</sup></a>
having in them an accidental, not an essential
goodness. But it would require both much time and labour
to collect together all the titles of the Son of God, such <i>e.g.</i>
as the true light, or the door, or the righteousness, or the
sanctification, or the redemption, and countless others; and to
show for what reasons each one of them is so given. Satisfied,
therefore, with what we have already advanced, we go on
with our inquiries into those other matters which follow.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>
  <h4 id='de-principiis-b1-c3' class='c010'>CHAPTER <abbr title='three'>III.</abbr> <br> ON THE HOLY SPIRIT.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c005'>1. The next point is to investigate as briefly as possible
the subject of the Holy Spirit. All who perceive, in whatever
manner, the existence of Providence, confess that God,
who created and disposed all things, is unbegotten, and recognise
Him as the parent of the universe. Now, that to Him
belongs a Son, is a statement not made by us only; although
it may seem a sufficiently marvellous and incredible assertion
to those who have a reputation as philosophers among Greeks
and Barbarians, by some of whom, however, an idea of His
existence seems to have been entertained, in their acknowledging
that all things were created by the word or reason
of God. We, however, in conformity with our belief in that
doctrine, which we assuredly hold to be divinely inspired,
believe that it is possible in no other way to explain and bring
within the reach of human knowledge this higher and diviner
reason as the Son of God, than by means of those Scriptures
alone which were inspired by the Holy Spirit, <i>i.e.</i> the gospels
and epistles, and the law and the prophets, according to the
declaration of Christ Himself. Of the existence of the Holy
Spirit no one indeed could entertain any suspicion, save those
who were familiar with the law and the prophets, or those
who profess a belief in Christ. For although no one is able
to speak with certainty of God the Father, it is nevertheless
possible for some knowledge of Him to be gained by means
of the visible creation and the natural feelings of the human
mind; and it is possible, moreover, for such knowledge to be
confirmed from the sacred Scriptures. But with respect to
the Son of God, although no one knoweth the Son save the
Father, yet it is from sacred Scripture also that the human
mind is taught how to think of the Son; and that not only
from the New, but also from the Old Testament, by means
of those things which, although done by the saints, are figuratively
referred to Christ, and from which both His divine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>nature, and that human nature which was assumed by Him,
may be discovered.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Now, what the Holy Spirit is, we are taught in many
passages of Scripture, as by David in the fifty-first Psalm,
when he says, “And take not Thy Holy Spirit from me;”<a id='r73'></a><a href='#f73' class='c007'><sup>[73]</sup></a>
and by Daniel, where it is said, “The Holy Spirit which is
in thee.”<a id='r74'></a><a href='#f74' class='c007'><sup>[74]</sup></a> And in the New Testament we have abundant
testimonies, as when the Holy Spirit is described as having
descended upon Christ, and when the Lord breathed upon His
apostles after His resurrection, saying, “Receive the Holy
Spirit;”<a id='r75'></a><a href='#f75' class='c007'><sup>[75]</sup></a> and the saying of the angel to Mary, “The Holy
Spirit will come upon thee;”<a id='r76'></a><a href='#f76' class='c007'><sup>[76]</sup></a> the declaration by Paul, that
no one can call Jesus Lord, save by the Holy Spirit.<a id='r77'></a><a href='#f77' class='c007'><sup>[77]</sup></a> In the
Acts of the Apostles, the Holy Spirit was given by the imposition
of the apostles’ hands in baptism.<a id='r78'></a><a href='#f78' class='c007'><sup>[78]</sup></a> From all which we
learn that the person of the Holy Spirit was of such authority
and dignity, that saving baptism was not complete except
by the authority of the most excellent Trinity of them all,
<i>i.e.</i> by the naming of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and by
joining to the unbegotten God the Father, and to His only-begotten
Son, the name also of the Holy Spirit. Who, then,
is not amazed at the exceeding majesty of the Holy Spirit,
when he hears that he who speaks a word against the Son
of man may hope for forgiveness; but that he who is guilty
of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit has not forgiveness,
either in the present world or in that which is to come!<a id='r79'></a><a href='#f79' class='c007'><sup>[79]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>3. That all things were created by God, and that there is
no creature which exists but has derived from Him its being,
is established from many declarations of Scripture; those
assertions being refuted and rejected which are falsely alleged
by some respecting the existence either of a matter co-eternal
with God, or of unbegotten souls, in which they would have
it that God implanted not so much the power of existence,
as equality and order. For even in that little treatise called
<i>The Pastor or Angel of Repentance</i>, composed by Hermas, we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>have the following: “First of all, believe that there is one
God who created and arranged all things; who, when nothing
formerly existed, caused all things to be; who Himself contains
all things, but Himself is contained by none.”<a id='r80'></a><a href='#f80' class='c007'><sup>[80]</sup></a> And
in the book of Enoch also we have similar descriptions. But
up to the present time we have been able to find no statement
in holy Scripture in which the Holy Spirit could be
said to be made or created,<a id='r81'></a><a href='#f81' class='c007'><sup>[81]</sup></a> not even in the way in which
we have shown above that the divine wisdom is spoken of by
Solomon, or in which those expressions which we have discussed
are to be understood of the life, or the word, or the
other appellations of the Son of God. The Spirit of God,
therefore, which was borne upon the waters, as is written in
the beginning of the creation of the world, is, I am of opinion,
no other than the Holy Spirit, so far as I can understand;
as indeed we have shown in our exposition of the passages
themselves, not according to the historical, but according to
the spiritual method of interpretation.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. Some indeed of our predecessors have observed, that
in the New Testament, whenever the Spirit is named without
that adjunct which denotes quality, the Holy Spirit is to be
understood; as <i>e.g.</i> in the expression, “Now the fruit of the
Spirit is love, joy, and peace;”<a id='r82'></a><a href='#f82' class='c007'><sup>[82]</sup></a> and, “Seeing ye began in
the Spirit, are ye now made perfect in the flesh?”<a id='r83'></a><a href='#f83' class='c007'><sup>[83]</sup></a> We
are of opinion that this distinction may be observed in the
Old Testament also, as when it is said, “He that giveth His
Spirit to the people who are upon the earth, and Spirit to
them who walk thereon.”<a id='r84'></a><a href='#f84' class='c007'><sup>[84]</sup></a> For, without doubt, every one
who walks upon the earth (<i>i.e.</i> earthly and corporeal beings)
is a partaker also of the Holy Spirit, receiving it from God.
My Hebrew master also used to say that those two seraphim
in Isaiah, which are described as having each six wings, and
calling to one another, and saying, “Holy, holy, holy is the
Lord God of hosts,”<a id='r85'></a><a href='#f85' class='c007'><sup>[85]</sup></a> were to be understood of the only-begotten
Son of God and of the Holy Spirit. And we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>think that that expression also which occurs in the hymn of
Habakkuk, “In the midst either of the two living things, or
of the two lives, Thou wilt be known,”<a id='r86'></a><a href='#f86' class='c007'><sup>[86]</sup></a> ought to be understood
of Christ and of the Holy Spirit. For all knowledge
of the Father is obtained by revelation of the Son through
the Holy Spirit, so that both of these beings which, according
to the prophet, are called either “living things” or “lives,”
exist as the ground of the knowledge of God the Father.
For as it is said of the Son, that “no one knoweth the Father
but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal Him,”<a id='r87'></a><a href='#f87' class='c007'><sup>[87]</sup></a>
the same also is said by the apostle of the Holy Spirit, when
he declares, “God hath revealed them to us by His Holy
Spirit; for the Spirit searcheth all things, even the deep
things of God;”<a id='r88'></a><a href='#f88' class='c007'><sup>[88]</sup></a> and again in the Gospel, when the
Saviour, speaking of the divine and profounder parts of His
teaching, which His disciples were not yet able to receive,
thus addresses them: “I have yet many things to say unto
you, but ye cannot bear them now; but when the Holy
Spirit, the Comforter, is come, He will teach you all things,
and will bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I
have said unto you.”<a id='r89'></a><a href='#f89' class='c007'><sup>[89]</sup></a> We must understand, therefore, that
as the Son, who alone knows the Father, reveals Him to
whom He will, so the Holy Spirit, who alone searches the
deep things of God, reveals God to whom He will: “For
the Spirit bloweth where He listeth.”<a id='r90'></a><a href='#f90' class='c007'><sup>[90]</sup></a> We are not, however,
to suppose that the Spirit derives His knowledge through
revelation from the Son. For if the Holy Spirit knows the
Father through the Son’s revelation, He passes from a state
of ignorance into one of knowledge; but it is alike impious
and foolish to confess the Holy Spirit, and yet to ascribe to
Him ignorance. For even although something else existed
before the Holy Spirit, it was not by progressive advancement
that He came to be the Holy Spirit; as if any one
should venture to say, that at the time when He was not yet
the Holy Spirit He was ignorant of the Father, but that
after He had received knowledge He was made the Holy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>Spirit. For if this were the case, the Holy Spirit would
never be reckoned in the unity of the Trinity, <i>i.e.</i> along
with the unchangeable Father and His Son, unless He had
always been the Holy Spirit. When we use, indeed, such
terms as “always” or “was,” or any other designation of
time, they are not to be taken absolutely, but with due
allowance; for while the significations of these words relate
to time, and those subjects of which we speak are spoken of
by a stretch of language as existing in time, they nevertheless
surpass in their real nature all conception of the finite
understanding.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. Nevertheless it seems proper to inquire what is the
reason why he who is regenerated by God unto salvation has
to do both with Father and Son and Holy Spirit, and does
not obtain salvation unless with the co-operation of the entire
Trinity; and why it is impossible to become partaker of the
Father or the Son without the Holy Spirit. And in discussing
these subjects, it will undoubtedly be necessary to
describe the special working of the Holy Spirit, and of the
Father and the Son. I am of opinion, then, that the working
of the Father and of the Son takes place as well in saints as
in sinners, in rational beings and in dumb animals; nay,
even in those things which are without life, and in all things
universally which exist; but that the operation of the Holy
Spirit does not take place at all in those things which are
without life, or in those which, although living, are yet dumb;
nay, is not found even in those who are endued indeed with
reason, but are engaged in evil courses, and not at all converted
to a better life. In those persons alone do I think
that the operation of the Holy Spirit takes place, who are
already turning to a better life, and walking along the way
which leads to Jesus Christ, <i>i.e.</i> who are engaged in the
performance of good actions, and who abide in God.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. That the working of the Father and the Son operates
both in saints and in sinners, is manifest from this, that all who
are rational beings are partakers of the word, <i>i.e.</i> of reason,
and by this means bear certain seeds, implanted within them,
of wisdom and justice, which is Christ. Now, in Him who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>truly exists, and who said by Moses, “I am what I am,”<a id='r91'></a><a href='#f91' class='c007'><sup>[91]</sup></a> all
things, whatever they are, participate; which participation in
God the Father is shared both by just men and sinners, by
rational and irrational beings, and by all things universally
which exist. The Apostle Paul also shows truly that all
have a share in Christ, when he says, “Say not in thine
heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (<i>i.e.</i> to bring Christ
down from above;) or who shall descend into the deep?
(that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.) But what
saith the Scripture? The word is nigh thee, even in thy
mouth, and in thy heart.”<a id='r92'></a><a href='#f92' class='c007'><sup>[92]</sup></a> By which he means that Christ
is in the heart of all, in respect of His being the word or
reason, by participating in which they are rational beings.
That declaration also in the Gospel, “If I had not come
and spoken unto them, they had not had sin; but now they
have no excuse for their sin,”<a id='r93'></a><a href='#f93' class='c007'><sup>[93]</sup></a> renders it manifest and patent
to all who have a rational knowledge of how long a time
man is without sin, and from what period he is liable to it,
how, by participating in the word or reason, men are said to
have sinned, viz. from the time they are made capable of
understanding and knowledge, when the reason implanted
within has suggested to them the difference between good
and evil; and after they have already begun to know what
evil is, they are made liable to sin, if they commit it. And
this is the meaning of the expression, that “men have no
excuse for their sin,” viz. that, from the time the divine
word or reason has begun to show them internally the
difference between good and evil, they ought to avoid and
guard against that which is wicked: “For to him who
knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.”<a id='r94'></a><a href='#f94' class='c007'><sup>[94]</sup></a>
Moreover, that all men are not without communion with
God, is taught in the Gospel thus, by the Saviour’s words:
“The kingdom of God cometh not with observation; neither
shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! but the kingdom of
God is within you.”<a id='r95'></a><a href='#f95' class='c007'><sup>[95]</sup></a> But here we must see whether this
does not bear the same meaning with the expression in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Genesis: “And He breathed into his face the breath of life,
and man became a living soul.”<a id='r96'></a><a href='#f96' class='c007'><sup>[96]</sup></a> For if this be understood
as applying generally to all men, then all men have a share
in God.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. But if this is to be understood as spoken of the Spirit
of God, since Adam also is found to have prophesied of some
things, it may be taken not as of general application, but as
confined to those who are saints. Finally, also, at the time
of the flood, when all flesh had corrupted their way before
God, it is recorded that God spoke thus, as of undeserving
men and sinners: “My Spirit shall not abide with those
men for ever, because they are flesh.”<a id='r97'></a><a href='#f97' class='c007'><sup>[97]</sup></a> By which it is
clearly shown that the Spirit of God is taken away from all
who are unworthy. In the Psalms also it is written: “Thou
wilt take away their spirit, and they will die, and return to
their earth. Thou wilt send forth Thy Spirit, and they shall
be created, and Thou wilt renew the face of the earth;”<a id='r98'></a><a href='#f98' class='c007'><sup>[98]</sup></a>
which is manifestly intended of the Holy Spirit, who, after
sinners and unworthy persons have been taken away and
destroyed, creates for Himself a new people, and renews the
face of the earth, when, laying aside, through the grace of
the Spirit, the old man with his deeds, they begin to walk
in newness of life. And therefore the expression is competently
applied to the Holy Spirit, because He will take up
His dwelling, not in all men, nor in those who are flesh, but
in those whose land<a id='r99'></a><a href='#f99' class='c007'><sup>[99]</sup></a> has been renewed. Lastly, for this
reason was the grace and revelation of the Holy Spirit
bestowed by the imposition of the apostles’ hands after
baptism. Our Saviour also, after the resurrection, when
old things had already passed away, and all things had
become new, Himself a new man, and the first-born from
the dead, His apostles also being renewed by faith in His
resurrection, says, “Receive the Holy Spirit.”<a id='r100'></a><a href='#f100' class='c007'><sup>[100]</sup></a> This is
doubtless what the Lord the Saviour meant to convey in
the Gospel, when He said that new wine cannot be put
into old bottles, but commanded that the bottles should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>made new, <i>i.e.</i> that men should walk in newness of life, that
they might receive the new wine, <i>i.e.</i> the newness of grace
of the Holy Spirit. In this manner, then, is the working
of the power of God the Father and of the Son extended
without distinction to every creature; but a share in the
Holy Spirit we find possessed only by the saints. And
therefore it is said, “No man can say that Jesus is Lord,
but by the Holy Ghost.”<a id='r101'></a><a href='#f101' class='c007'><sup>[101]</sup></a> And on one occasion, scarcely
even the apostles themselves are deemed worthy to hear the
words, “Ye shall receive the power of the Holy Ghost
coming upon you.”<a id='r102'></a><a href='#f102' class='c007'><sup>[102]</sup></a> For this reason, also, I think it follows
that he who has committed a sin against the Son of man is
deserving of forgiveness; because if he who is a participator
of the word or reason of God cease to live agreeably to reason,
he seems to have fallen into a state of ignorance or folly, and
therefore to deserve forgiveness; whereas he who has been
deemed worthy to have a portion of the Holy Spirit, and
who has relapsed, is, by this very act and work, said to be
guilty of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. Let no one
indeed suppose that we, from having said that the Holy
Spirit is conferred upon the saints alone, but that the benefits
or operations of the Father and of the Son extend to good
and bad, to just and unjust, by so doing give a preference
to the Holy Spirit over the Father and the Son, or assert
that His dignity is greater, which certainly would be a very
illogical conclusion. For it is the peculiarity of His grace
and operations that we have been describing. Moreover,
nothing in the Trinity can be called greater or less, since the
fountain of divinity alone contains all things by His word
and reason, and by the Spirit of His mouth sanctifies all
things which are worthy of sanctification, as it is written in
the Psalm: “By the word of the Lord were the heavens
strengthened, and all their power by the Spirit of His
mouth.”<a id='r103'></a><a href='#f103' class='c007'><sup>[103]</sup></a> There is also a special working of God the Father,
besides that by which He bestowed upon all things the gift
of natural life. There is also a special ministry of the Lord
Jesus Christ to those upon whom He confers by nature the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>gift of reason, by means of which they are enabled to be
rightly what they are. There is also another grace of the
Holy Spirit, which is bestowed upon the deserving, through
the ministry of Christ and the working of the Father, in
proportion to the merits of those who are rendered capable of
receiving it. This is most clearly pointed out by the Apostle
Paul, when demonstrating that the power of the Trinity is
one and the same, in the words, “There are diversities of
gifts, but the same Spirit; there are diversities of administrations,
but the same Lord; and there are diversities of
operations, but it is the same God who worketh all in all.
But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to
profit withal.”<a id='r104'></a><a href='#f104' class='c007'><sup>[104]</sup></a> From which it most clearly follows that
there is no difference in the Trinity, but that which is called
the gift of the Spirit is made known through the Son, and
operated by God the Father. “But all these worketh that
one and the self-same Spirit, dividing to every one severally
as He will.”<a id='r105'></a><a href='#f105' class='c007'><sup>[105]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>8. Having made these declarations regarding the unity of
the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, let us
return to the order in which we began the discussion. God
the Father bestows upon all, existence; and participation in
Christ, in respect of His being the word of reason, renders
them rational beings. From which it follows that they are
deserving either of praise or blame, because capable of virtue
and vice. On this account, therefore, is the grace of the
Holy Ghost present, that those beings which are not holy
in their essence may be rendered holy by participating in it.
Seeing, then, that firstly, they derive their existence from
God the Father; secondly, their rational nature from the
Word; thirdly, their holiness from the Holy Spirit,—those
who have been previously sanctified by the Holy Spirit are
again made capable of receiving Christ, in respect that He
is the righteousness of God; and those who have earned
advancement to this grade by the sanctification of the Holy
Spirit, will nevertheless obtain the gift of wisdom according
to the power and working of the Spirit of God. And this I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>consider is Paul’s meaning, when he says that to “some is
given the word of wisdom, to others the word of knowledge,
according to the same Spirit.” And while pointing out the
individual distinction of gifts, he refers the whole of them
to the source of all things in the words, “There are diversities
of operations, but one God who worketh all in all.”<a id='r106'></a><a href='#f106' class='c007'><sup>[106]</sup></a>
Whence also the working of the Father, which confers
existence upon all things, is found to be more glorious and
magnificent, while each one, by participation in Christ, as
being wisdom, and knowledge, and sanctification, makes progress,
and advances to higher degrees of perfection; and
seeing it is by partaking of the Holy Spirit that any one
is made purer and holier, he obtains, when he is made worthy,
the grace of wisdom and knowledge, in order that, after all
stains of pollution and ignorance are cleansed and taken away,
he may make so great an advance in holiness and purity, that
the nature which he received from God may become such as
is worthy of Him who gave it to be pure and perfect, so that
the being which exists may be as worthy as He who called
it into existence. For, in this way, he who is such as his
Creator wished him to be, will receive from God power
always to exist, and to abide for ever. That this may be the
case, and that those whom He has created may be unceasingly
and inseparably present with Him, who IS, it is the
business of wisdom to instruct and train them, and to bring
them to perfection by confirmation of His Holy Spirit and
unceasing sanctification, by which alone are they capable of
receiving God. In this way, then, by the renewal of the
ceaseless working of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in us, in
its various stages of progress, shall we be able at some future
time perhaps, although with difficulty, to behold the holy and
the blessed life, in which (as it is only after many struggles
that we are able to reach it) we ought so to continue, that
no satiety of that blessedness should ever seize us; but the
more we perceive its blessedness, the more should be increased
and intensified within us the longing for the same, while
we ever more eagerly and freely receive and hold fast the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. But if satiety
should ever take hold of any one of those who stand on the
highest and perfect summit of attainment, I do not think
that such an one would suddenly be deposed from his position
and fall away, but that he must decline gradually and
little by little, so that it may sometimes happen that if a brief
lapsus take place, and the individual quickly repent and return
to himself, he may not utterly fall away, but may retrace
his steps, and return to his former place, and again make
good that which had been lost by his negligence.</p>

<h4 id='de-principiis-b1-c4' class='c010'>CHAPTER <abbr title='four'>IV.</abbr> <br> ON DEFECTION, OR FALLING AWAY.</h4>
<p class='c005'>1. To exhibit the nature of defection or falling away, on
the part of those who conduct themselves carelessly, it will
not appear out of place to employ a similitude by way of
illustration. Suppose, then, the case of one who had become
gradually acquainted with the art or science, say of geometry
or medicine, until he had reached perfection, having trained
himself for a lengthened time in its principles and practice,
so as to attain a complete mastery over the art: to such an
one it could never happen, that, when he lay down to sleep
in the possession of his skill, he should awake in a state of
ignorance. It is not our purpose to adduce or to notice here
those accidents which are occasioned by any injury or weakness,
for they do not apply to our present illustration. According
to our point of view, then, so long as that geometer
or physician continues to exercise himself in the study of his
art and in the practice of its principles, the knowledge of
his profession abides with him; but if he withdraw from its
practice, and lay aside his habits of industry, then, by his
neglect, at first a few things will gradually escape him, then
by and by more and more, until in course of time everything
will be forgotten, and be completely effaced from the
memory. It is possible, indeed, that when he has first begun
to fall away, and to yield to the corrupting influence of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>negligence which is small as yet, he may, if he be aroused
and return speedily to his senses, repair those losses which
up to that time are only recent, and recover that knowledge
which hitherto had been only slightly obliterated from his
mind. Let us apply this now to the case of those who have
devoted themselves to the knowledge and wisdom of God,
whose learning and diligence incomparably surpass all other
training; and let us contemplate, according to the form of
the similitude employed, what is the acquisition of knowledge,
or what is its disappearance, especially when we hear from
the apostle what is said of those who are perfect, that they
shall behold face to face the glory of the Lord in the revelation
of His mysteries.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. But in our desire to show the divine benefits bestowed
upon us by Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, which Trinity is
the fountain of all holiness, we have fallen, in what we have
said, into a digression, having considered that the subject
of the soul, which accidentally came before us, should be
touched on, although cursorily, seeing we were discussing a
cognate topic relating to our rational nature. We shall, however,
with the permission of God through Jesus Christ and
the Holy Spirit, more conveniently consider in the proper
place the subject of all rational beings, which are distinguished
into three genera and species.</p>
<h4 id='de-principiis-b1-c5' class='c010'>CHAPTER <abbr title='five'>V.</abbr> <br> ON RATIONAL NATURES.</h4>
<p class='c005'>1. After the dissertation, which we have briefly conducted
to the best of our ability, regarding the Father, Son, and
Holy Spirit, it follows that we offer a few remarks upon the
subject of rational natures, and on their species and orders,
or on the offices as well of holy as of malignant powers,
and also on those which occupy an intermediate position between
these good and evil powers, and as yet are placed in a
state of struggle and trial. For we find in holy Scripture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>numerous names of certain orders and offices, not only of
holy beings, but also of those of an opposite description,
which we shall bring before us, in the first place; and the
meaning of which we shall endeavour, in the second place,
to the best of our ability, to ascertain. There are certain
holy angels of God whom Paul terms “ministering spirits,
sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation.”<a id='r107'></a><a href='#f107' class='c007'><sup>[107]</sup></a>
In the writings also of St. Paul himself we find him
designating them, from some unknown source, as thrones,
and dominions, and principalities, and powers; and after this
enumeration, as if knowing that there were still other rational
offices<a id='r108'></a><a href='#f108' class='c007'><sup>[108]</sup></a> and orders besides those which he had named, he says
of the Saviour: “Who is above all principality, and power,
and might, and dominion, and every name that is named,
not only in this world, but also in that which is to come.”<a id='r109'></a><a href='#f109' class='c007'><sup>[109]</sup></a>
From which he shows that there were certain beings besides
those which he had mentioned, which may be named indeed
in this world, but were not now enumerated by him, and
perhaps were not known by any other individual; and that
there were others which may not be named in this world,
but will be named in the world to come.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Then, in the next place, we must know that every being
which is endowed with reason, and transgresses its statutes
and limitations, is undoubtedly involved in sin by swerving
from rectitude and justice. Every rational creature, therefore,
is capable of earning praise and censure: of praise, if,
in conformity to that reason which he possesses, he advance
to better things; of censure, if he fall away from the plan
and course of rectitude, for which reason he is justly liable
to pains and penalties. And this also is to be held as applying
to the devil himself, and those who are with him, and
are called his angels. Now the titles of these beings have
to be explained, that we may know what they are of whom
we have to speak. The name, then, of Devil, and Satan,
and Wicked One, who is also described as Enemy of God, is
mentioned in many passages of Scripture. Moreover, certain
angels of the devil are mentioned, and also a prince of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>world, who, whether the devil himself or some one else, is
not yet clearly manifest. There are also certain princes of
this world spoken of as possessing a kind of wisdom which
will come to nought; but whether these are those princes
who are also the principalities with whom we have to wrestle,
or other beings, seems to me a point on which it is not easy
for any one to pronounce. After the principalities, certain
powers also are named with whom we have to wrestle, and
carry on a struggle even against the princes of this world
and the rulers of this darkness. Certain spiritual powers of
wickedness also, in heavenly places, are spoken of by Paul
himself. What, moreover, are we to say of those wicked
and unclean spirits mentioned in the gospel? Then we have
certain heavenly beings called by a similar name, but which
are said to bend the knee, or to be about to bend the knee,
at the name of Jesus; nay, even things on earth and things
under the earth, which Paul enumerates in order. And
certainly, in a place where we have been discussing the
subject of rational natures, it is not proper to be silent regarding
ourselves, who are human beings, and are called
rational animals; nay, even this point is not to be idly passed
over, that even of us human beings certain different orders
are mentioned in the words, “The portion of the Lord is
His people Jacob; Israel is the cord of His inheritance.”<a id='r110'></a><a href='#f110' class='c007'><sup>[110]</sup></a>
Other nations, moreover, are called a part of the angels;
since “when the Most High divided the nations, and dispersed
the sons of Adam, He fixed the boundaries of the
nations according to the number of the angels of God.”<a id='r111'></a><a href='#f111' class='c007'><sup>[111]</sup></a>
And therefore, with other rational natures, we must also
thoroughly examine the reason of the human soul.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. After the enumeration, then, of so many and so important
names of orders and offices, underlying which it is certain
that there are personal existences, let us inquire whether God,
the creator and founder of all things, created certain of them
holy and happy, so that they could admit no element at all of
an opposite kind, and certain others so that they were made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>capable both of virtue and vice; or whether we are to suppose
that He created some so as to be altogether incapable of
virtue, and others again altogether incapable of wickedness,
but with the power of abiding only in a state of happiness,
and others again such as to be capable of either condition.
In order, now, that our first inquiry may begin with the
names themselves, let us consider whether the holy angels,
from the period of their first existence, have always been holy,
and are holy still, and will be holy, and have never either
admitted or had the power to admit any occasion of sin.
Then in the next place, let us consider whether those who are
called holy principalities began from the moment of their
creation by God to exercise power over some who were made
subject to them, and whether these latter were created of
such a nature, and formed for the very purpose of being subject
and subordinate. In like manner, also, whether those
which are called powers were created of such a nature and
for the express purpose of exercising power, or whether their
arriving at that power and dignity is a reward and desert of
their virtue. Moreover, also, whether those which are called
thrones or seats gained that stability of happiness at the same
time with their coming forth into being,<a id='r112'></a><a href='#f112' class='c007'><sup>[112]</sup></a> so as to have that
possession from the will of the Creator alone; or whether
those which are called dominions had their dominion conferred
on them, not as a reward for their proficiency, but as
the peculiar privilege of their creation,<a id='r113'></a><a href='#f113' class='c007'><sup>[113]</sup></a> so that it is something
which is in a certain degree inseparable from them,
and natural. Now, if we adopt the view that the holy
angels, and the holy powers, and the blessed seats, and
the glorious virtues, and the magnificent dominions, are to
be regarded as possessing those powers and dignities and
glories in virtue of their nature,<a id='r114'></a><a href='#f114' class='c007'><sup>[114]</sup></a> it will doubtless appear
to follow that those beings which have been mentioned as
holding offices of an opposite kind must be regarded in the
same manner; so that those principalities with whom we have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>to struggle are to be viewed, not as having received that spirit
of opposition and resistance to all good at a later period, or as
falling away from good through the freedom of the will, but
as having had it in themselves as the essence of their being
from the beginning of their existence. In like manner also
will it be the case with the powers and virtues, in none of
which was wickedness subsequent or posterior to their first
existence. Those also whom the apostle termed rulers and
princes of the darkness of this world, are said, with respect to
their rule and occupation of darkness, to fall not from perversity
of intention, but from the necessity of their creation.
Logical reasoning will compel us to take the same view with
regard to wicked and malignant spirits and unclean demons.
But if to entertain this view regarding malignant and opposing
powers seem to be absurd, as it is certainly absurd that
the cause of their wickedness should be removed from the
purpose of their own will, and ascribed of necessity to their
Creator, why should we not also be obliged to make a
similar confession regarding the good and holy powers, that,
viz., the good which is in them is not theirs by essential being,
which we have manifestly shown to be the case with Christ
and the Holy Spirit alone, as undoubtedly with the Father
also? For it was proved that there was nothing compound in
the nature of the Trinity, so that these qualities might seem
to belong to it as accidental consequences. From which it
follows, that in the case of every creature it is a result of his
own works and movements, that those powers which appear
either to hold sway over others or to exercise power or dominion,
have been preferred to and placed over those whom
they are said to govern or exercise power over, and not in
consequence of a peculiar privilege inherent in their constitutions,
but on account of merit.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. But that we may not appear to build our assertions
on subjects of such importance and difficulty on the ground
of inference alone, or to require the assent of our hearers to
what is only conjectural, let us see whether we can obtain any
declarations from holy Scripture, by the authority of which
these positions may be more credibly maintained. And,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>firstly, we shall adduce what holy Scripture contains regarding
wicked powers; we shall next continue our investigation with
regard to the others, as the Lord shall be pleased to enlighten
us, that in matters of such difficulty we may ascertain what
is nearest to the truth, or what ought to be our opinions agreeably
to the standard of religion. Now we find in the prophet
Ezekiel two prophecies written to the prince of Tyre, the
former of which might appear to any one, before he heard
the second also, to be spoken of some man who was prince
of the Tyrians. In the meantime, therefore, we shall take
nothing from that first prophecy; but as the second is manifestly
of such a kind as cannot be at all understood of a
man, but of some superior power which had fallen away
from a higher position, and had been reduced to a lower and
worse condition, we shall from it take an illustration, by
which it may be demonstrated with the utmost clearness,
that those opposing and malignant powers were not formed
or created so by nature, but fell from a better to a worse
position, and were converted into wicked beings; that those
blessed powers also were not of such a nature as to be unable
to admit what was opposed to them if they were so inclined
and became negligent, and did not guard most carefully the
blessedness of their condition. For if it is related that he
who is called the prince of Tyre was amongst the saints,
and was without stain, and was placed in the paradise of
God, and adorned also with a crown of comeliness and
beauty, is it to be supposed that such an one could be in
any degree inferior to any of the saints? For he is described
as having been adorned with a crown of comeliness
and beauty, and as having walked stainless in the paradise of
God: and how can any one suppose that such a being was
not one of those holy and blessed powers which, as being
placed in a state of happiness, we must believe to be endowed
with no other honour than this? But let us see what we
are taught by the words of the prophecy themselves. “The
word of the Lord,” says the prophet, “came to me, saying,
Son of man, take up a lamentation over the prince of Tyre,
and say to him, Thus saith the Lord God, Thou hast been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>the seal of a similitude, and a crown of comeliness among
the delights of paradise; thou wert adorned with every
good stone or gem, and wert clothed with sardonyx, and
topaz, and emerald, and carbuncle, and sapphire, and jasper,
set in gold and silver, and with agate, amethyst, and chrysolite,
and beryl, and onyx: with gold also didst thou fill
thy treasures, and thy storehouses within thee. From the
day when thou wert created along with the cherubim, I
placed thee in the holy mount of God. Thou wert in the
midst of the fiery stones: thou wert stainless in thy days,
from the day when thou wert created, until iniquities were
found in thee: from the greatness of thy trade, thou didst
fill thy storehouses with iniquity, and didst sin, and wert
wounded from the mount of God. And a cherub drove
thee forth from the midst of the burning stones; and thy
heart was elated because of thy comeliness, thy discipline
was corrupted along with thy beauty: on account of the
multitude of thy sins, I cast thee forth to the earth before
kings; I gave thee for a show and a mockery on account of
the multitude of thy sins, and of thine iniquities: because of
thy trade thou hast polluted thy holy places. And I shall
bring forth fire from the midst of thee, and it shall devour
thee, and I shall give thee for ashes and cinders on the earth
in the sight of all who see thee: and all who know thee
among the nations shall mourn over thee. Thou hast been
made destruction, and thou shalt exist no longer for ever.”<a id='r115'></a><a href='#f115' class='c007'><sup>[115]</sup></a>
Seeing, then, that such are the words of the prophet, who is
there that on hearing, “Thou wert a seal of a similitude, and
a crown of comeliness among the delights of paradise,” or
that “From the day when thou wert created with the cherubim,
I placed thee in the holy mount of God,” can so enfeeble
the meaning as to suppose that this language is used
of some man or saint, not to say the prince of Tyre? Or
what fiery stones can he imagine in the midst of which any
man could live? Or who could be supposed to be stainless
from the very day of his creation, and wickedness being afterwards
discovered in him, it be said of him then that he was cast
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>forth upon the earth? For the meaning of this is, that He
who was not yet on the earth is said to be cast forth upon it:
whose holy places also are said to be polluted. We have
shown, then, that what we have quoted regarding the prince
of Tyre from the prophet Ezekiel refers to an adverse
power, and by it it is most clearly proved that that power
was formerly holy and happy; from which state of happiness
it fell from the time that iniquity was found in it, and
was hurled to the earth, and was not such by nature and
creation. We are of opinion, therefore, that these words
are spoken of a certain angel who had received the office of
governing the nation of the Tyrians, and to whom also their
souls had been entrusted to be taken care of. But what
Tyre, or what souls of Tyrians, we ought to understand,
whether that Tyre which is situated within the boundaries
of the province of Phœnicia, or some other of which this one
which we know on earth is the model; and the souls of the
Tyrians, whether they are those of the former or those which
belong to that Tyre which is spiritually understood, does not
seem to be a matter requiring examination in this place; lest
perhaps we should appear to investigate subjects of so much
mystery and importance in a cursory manner, whereas they
demand a labour and work of their own.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. Again, we are taught as follows by the prophet Isaiah
regarding another opposing power. The prophet says, “How
is Lucifer, who used to arise in the morning, fallen from
heaven! He who assailed all nations is broken and beaten
to the ground. Thou indeed saidst in thy heart, I shall
ascend into heaven; above the stars of heaven shall I place
my throne; I shall sit upon a lofty mountain, above the lofty
mountains which are towards the north; I shall ascend above
the clouds; I shall be like the Most High. Now shalt thou
be brought down to the lower world, and to the foundations
of the earth. They who see thee shall be amazed at thee,
and shall say, This is the man who harassed the whole earth,
who moved kings, who made the whole world a desert, who
destroyed cities, and did not unloose those who were in chains.
All the kings of the nations have slept in honour, every one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>in his own house; but thou shalt be cast forth on the mountains,
accursed with the many dead who have been pierced
through with swords, and have descended to the lower world.
As a garment clotted with blood, and stained, will not be
clean; neither shalt thou be clean, because thou hast destroyed
my land and slain my people: thou shalt not remain for ever,
most wicked seed. Prepare thy sons for death on account of
the sins of thy father, lest they rise again and inherit the
earth, and fill the earth with wars. And I shall rise against
them, saith the Lord of hosts, and I shall cause their name
to perish, and their remains, and their seed.”<a id='r116'></a><a href='#f116' class='c007'><sup>[116]</sup></a> Most evidently
by these words is he shown to have fallen from heaven, who
formerly was Lucifer, and who used to arise in the morning.
For if, as some think, he was a nature of darkness, how is
Lucifer said to have existed before? Or how could he arise
in the morning, who had in himself nothing of the light?
Nay, even the Saviour Himself teaches us, saying of the devil,
“Behold, I see Satan fallen from heaven like lightning.”<a id='r117'></a><a href='#f117' class='c007'><sup>[117]</sup></a>
For at one time he was light. Moreover our Lord, who is
the truth, compared the power of His own glorious advent to
lightning, in the words, “For as the lightning shineth from the
height of heaven even to its height again, so will the coming
of the Son of man be.”<a id='r118'></a><a href='#f118' class='c007'><sup>[118]</sup></a> And notwithstanding He compares
him to lightning, and says that he fell from heaven, that He
might show by this that he had been at one time in heaven,
and had had a place among the saints, and had enjoyed a share
in that light in which all the saints participate, by which
they are made angels of light, and by which the apostles are
termed by the Lord the light of the world. In this manner,
then, did that being once exist as light before he went astray,
and fell to this place, and had his glory turned into dust, which
is peculiarly the mark of the wicked, as the prophet also
says; whence, too, he was called the prince of this world, <i>i.e.</i>
of an earthly habitation: for he exercised power over those
who were obedient to his wickedness, since “the whole of
this world”—for I term this place of earth, world—“lieth
in the wicked one,”<a id='r119'></a><a href='#f119' class='c007'><sup>[119]</sup></a> and in this apostate. That he is an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>apostate, <i>i.e.</i> a fugitive, even the Lord in the book of Job
says, “Thou wilt take with a hook the apostate dragon,” <i>i.e.</i> a
fugitive.<a id='r120'></a><a href='#f120' class='c007'><sup>[120]</sup></a> Now it is certain that by the dragon is understood
the devil himself. If then they are called opposing powers,
and are said to have been once without stain, while spotless
purity exists in the essential being of none save the Father,
Son, and Holy Spirit, but is an accidental quality in every
created thing; and since that which is accidental may also
fall away, and since those opposite powers once were spotless,
and were once among those which still remain unstained, it
is evident from all this that no one is pure either by essence
or nature, and that no one was by nature polluted. And the
consequence of this is, that it lies within ourselves and in our
own actions to possess either happiness or holiness; or by
sloth and negligence to fall from happiness into wickedness
and ruin, to such a degree that, through too great proficiency,
so to speak, in wickedness (if a man be guilty of so great
neglect), he may descend even to that state in which he will
be changed into what is called an “opposing power.”</p>

<h4 id='de-principiis-b1-c6' class='c010'>CHAPTER <abbr title='six'>VI.</abbr> <br> ON THE END OR CONSUMMATION.</h4>
<p class='c005'>1. An end or consummation would seem to be an indication
of the perfection and completion of things. And this
reminds us here, that if there be any one imbued with a
desire of reading and understanding subjects of such difficulty
and importance, he ought to bring to the effort a perfect and
instructed understanding, lest perhaps, if he has had no experience
in questions of this kind, they may appear to him as
vain and superfluous; or if his mind be full of preconceptions
and prejudices on other points, he may judge these to be
heretical and opposed to the faith of the church, yielding in
so doing not so much to the convictions of reason as to the
dogmatism of prejudice. These subjects, indeed, are treated
by us with great solicitude and caution, in the manner rather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>of an investigation and discussion, than in that of fixed and
certain decision. For we have pointed out in the preceding
pages those questions which must be set forth in clear
dogmatic propositions, as I think has been done to the best
of my ability when speaking of the Trinity. But on the
present occasion our exercise is to be conducted, as we best
may, in the style of a disputation rather than of strict
definition.</p>

<p class='c006'>The end of the world, then, and the final consummation,
will take place when every one shall be subjected to punishment
for his sins; a time which God alone knows, when He
will bestow on each one what he deserves. We think, indeed,
that the goodness of God, through His Christ, may recall all
His creatures to one end, even His enemies being conquered
and subdued. For thus says holy Scripture, “The Lord
said to my Lord, Sit Thou at my right hand, until I make
Thine enemies Thy footstool.”<a id='r121'></a><a href='#f121' class='c007'><sup>[121]</sup></a> And if the meaning of the
prophet’s language here be less clear, we may ascertain it
from the Apostle Paul, who speaks more openly, thus: “For
Christ must reign until He has put all enemies under His
feet.”<a id='r122'></a><a href='#f122' class='c007'><sup>[122]</sup></a> But if even that unreserved declaration of the apostle
do not sufficiently inform us what is meant by “enemies
being placed under His feet,” listen to what he says in the
following words, “For all things must be put under Him.”
What, then, is this “putting under” by which all things must
be made subject to Christ? I am of opinion that it is this
very subjection by which we also wish to be subject to Him,
by which the apostles also were subject, and all the saints
who have been followers of Christ. For the name “subjection,”
by which we are subject to Christ, indicates that the
salvation which proceeds from Him belongs to His subjects,
agreeably to the declaration of David, “Shall not my soul be
subject unto God? From Him cometh my salvation.”<a id='r123'></a><a href='#f123' class='c007'><sup>[123]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>2. Seeing, then, that such is the end, when all enemies
will be subdued to Christ, when death—the last enemy—shall
be destroyed, and when the kingdom shall be delivered
up by Christ (to whom all things are subject) to God the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>Father; let us, I say, from such an end as this, contemplate
the beginnings of things. For the end is always like
the beginning: and, therefore, as there is one end to all
things, so ought we to understand that there was one beginning;
and as there is one end to many things, so there spring
from one beginning many differences and varieties, which
again, through the goodness of God, and by subjection to
Christ, and through the unity of the Holy Spirit, are recalled
to one end, which is like unto the beginning: all those, viz.,
who, bending the knee at the name of Jesus, make known
by so doing their subjection to Him: and these are they who
are in heaven, on earth, and under the earth: by which
three classes the whole universe of things is pointed out,
those, viz., who from that one beginning were arranged, each
according to the diversity of his conduct, among the different
orders, in accordance with their desert; for there was no goodness
in them by essential being, as in God and His Christ,
and in the Holy Spirit. For in the Trinity alone, which
is the author of all things, does goodness exist in virtue of
essential being; while others possess it as an accidental and
perishable quality, and only then enjoy blessedness, when
they participate in holiness and wisdom, and in divinity
itself. But if they neglect and despise such participation,
then is each one, by fault of his own slothfulness, made, one
more rapidly, another more slowly, one in a greater, another
in a less degree, the cause of his own downfall. And since,
as we have remarked, the lapse by which an individual
falls away from his position is characterized by great diversity,
according to the movements of the mind and will, one
man falling with greater ease, another with more difficulty,
into a lower condition; in this is to be seen the just judgment
of the providence of God, that it should happen to
every one according to the diversity of his conduct, in proportion
to the desert of his declension and defection. Certain
of those, indeed, who remained in that beginning which we
have described as resembling the end which is to come,
obtained, in the ordering and arrangement of the world, the
rank of angels; others that of influences, others of principalities,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>others of powers, that they may exercise power over
those who need to have power upon their head. Others, again,
received the rank of thrones, having the office of judging or
ruling those who require this; others dominion, doubtless,
over slaves; all of which are conferred by Divine Providence
in just and impartial judgment according to their merits,
and to the progress which they had made in the participation
and imitation of God. But those who have been removed
from their primal state of blessedness have not been removed
irrecoverably, but have been placed under the rule of those
holy and blessed orders which we have described; and by
availing themselves of the aid of these, and being remoulded
by salutary principles and discipline, they may recover themselves,
and be restored to their condition of happiness. From
all which I am of opinion, so far as I can see, that this order
of the human race has been appointed in order that in the
future world, or in ages to come, when there shall be the
new heavens and new earth, spoken of by Isaiah, it may be
restored to that unity promised by the Lord Jesus in His
prayer to God the Father on behalf of His disciples: “I do
not pray for these alone, but for all who shall believe on me
through their word: that they all may be one, as Thou,
Father, art in me, and I in Thee, that they also may be one
in us;”<a id='r124'></a><a href='#f124' class='c007'><sup>[124]</sup></a> and again, when He says: “That they may be one,
even as we are one; I in them, and Thou in me, that they
may be made perfect in one.”<a id='r125'></a><a href='#f125' class='c007'><sup>[125]</sup></a> And this is further confirmed
by the language of the Apostle Paul: “Until we all come in
the unity of the faith to a perfect man, to the measure of the
stature of the fulness of Christ.”<a id='r126'></a><a href='#f126' class='c007'><sup>[126]</sup></a> And in keeping with this
is the declaration of the same apostle, when he exhorts us,
who even in the present life are placed in the church, in
which is the form of that kingdom which is to come, to this
same similitude of unity: “That ye all speak the same thing,
and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be
perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same
judgment.”<a id='r127'></a><a href='#f127' class='c007'><sup>[127]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>3. It is to be borne in mind, however, that certain beings who
fell away from that one beginning of which we have spoken,
have sunk to such a depth of unworthiness and wickedness
as to be deemed altogether undeserving of that training and
instruction by which the human race, while in the flesh, are
trained and instructed with the assistance of the heavenly
powers; and continue, on the contrary, in a state of enmity
and opposition to those who are receiving this instruction
and teaching. And hence it is that the whole of this mortal
life is full of struggles and trials, caused by the opposition
and enmity of those who fell from a better condition without
at all looking back, and who are called the devil and his
angels, and the other orders of evil, which the apostle classed
among the opposing powers. But whether any of these orders
who act under the government of the devil, and obey his
wicked commands, will in a future world be converted to
righteousness because of their possessing the faculty of freedom
of will, or whether persistent and inveterate wickedness
may be changed by the power of habit into nature, is a result
which you yourself, reader, may approve of, if neither in
these present worlds which are seen and temporal, nor in
those which are unseen and are eternal, that portion is to
differ wholly from the final unity and fitness of things. But
in the meantime, both in those temporal worlds which are
seen, as well as in those eternal worlds which are invisible,
all those beings are arranged, according to a regular plan, in
the order and degree of their merits; so that some of them
in the first, others in the second, some even in the last times,
after having undergone heavier and severer punishments,
endured for a lengthened period, and for many ages, so to
speak, improved by this stern method of training, and restored
at first by the instruction of the angels, and subsequently by
the powers of a higher grade, and thus advancing through
each stage to a better condition, reach even to that which
is invisible and eternal, having travelled through, by a kind
of training, every single office of the heavenly powers. From
which, I think, this will appear to follow as an inference, that
every rational nature may, in passing from one order to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>another, go through each to all, and advance from all to each,
while made the subject of various degrees of proficiency and
failure according to its own actions and endeavours, put forth
in the enjoyment of its power of freedom of will.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. But since Paul says that certain things are visible and
temporal, and others besides these invisible and eternal, we
proceed to inquire how those things which are seen are temporal—whether
because there will be nothing at all after
them in all those periods of the coming world, in which that
dispersion and separation from the one beginning is undergoing
a process of restoration to one and the same end and
likeness; or because, while the form of those things which
are seen passes away, their essential nature is subject to no
corruption. And Paul seems to confirm the latter view,
when he says, “For the fashion of this world passeth away.”<a id='r128'></a><a href='#f128' class='c007'><sup>[128]</sup></a>
David also appears to assert the same in the words, “The
heavens shall perish, but Thou shalt endure; and they all
shall wax old as a garment, and Thou shalt change them like
a vesture, and like a vestment they shall be changed.”<a id='r129'></a><a href='#f129' class='c007'><sup>[129]</sup></a> For
if the heavens are to be changed, assuredly that which is
changed does not perish, and if the fashion of the world
passes away, it is by no means an annihilation or destruction
of their material substance that is shown to take place, but a
kind of change of quality and transformation of appearance.
Isaiah also, in declaring prophetically that there will be a
new heaven and a new earth, undoubtedly suggests a similar
view. For this renewal of heaven and earth, and this transmutation
of the form of the present world, and this changing
of the heavens, will undoubtedly be prepared for those who
are walking along that way which we have pointed out above,
and are tending to that goal of happiness to which, it is said,
even enemies themselves are to be subjected, and in which
God is said to be “all and in all.” And if any one imagine
that at the end material, <i>i.e.</i> bodily, nature will be entirely
destroyed, he cannot in any respect meet my view, how
beings so numerous and powerful are able to live and to
exist without bodies, since it is an attribute of the divine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>nature alone—<i>i.e.</i> of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—to
exist without any material substance, and without partaking
in any degree of a bodily adjunct. Another, perhaps, may
say that in the end every bodily substance will be so pure
and refined as to be like the æther, and of a celestial purity
and clearness. How things will be, however, is known with
certainty to God alone, and to those who are His friends
through Christ and the Holy Spirit.</p>

<h4 id='de-principiis-b1-c7' class='c010'>CHAPTER <abbr title='seven'>VII.</abbr> <br> ON INCORPOREAL AND CORPOREAL BEINGS.</h4>
<p class='c005'>1. The subjects considered in the previous chapter have
been spoken of in general language, the nature of rational
beings being discussed more by way of intelligent inference
than strict dogmatic definition, with the exception of the place
where we treated, to the best of our ability, of the persons
of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. We have now to ascertain
what those matters are which it is proper to treat in
the following pages according to our dogmatic belief, <i>i.e.</i> in
agreement with the creed of the church. All souls and all
rational natures, whether holy or wicked, were formed or
created, and all these, according to their proper nature, are
incorporeal; but although incorporeal, they were nevertheless
created, because all things were made by God through
Christ, as John teaches in a general way in his Gospel, saying,
“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with
God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning
with God. All things were made by Him, and without
Him was nothing made.”<a id='r130'></a><a href='#f130' class='c007'><sup>[130]</sup></a> The Apostle Paul, moreover,
describing created things by species and numbers and orders,
speaks as follows, when showing that all things were made
through Christ: “And in Him were all things created, that
are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible,
whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or
powers: all things were created by Him, and in Him: and
He is before all, and He is the head.”<a id='r131'></a><a href='#f131' class='c007'><sup>[131]</sup></a> He therefore manifestly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>declares that in Christ and through Christ were all
things made and created, whether things visible, which are
corporeal, or things invisible, which I regard as none other
than incorporeal and spiritual powers. But of those things
which he had termed generally corporeal or incorporeal, he
seems to me, in the words that follow, to enumerate the
various kinds, viz. thrones, dominions, principalities, powers,
influences.</p>

<p class='c006'>These matters now have been previously mentioned by
us, as we are desirous to come in an orderly manner to the
investigation of the sun, and moon, and stars by way of
logical inference, and to ascertain whether they also ought
properly to be reckoned among the principalities on account
of their being said to be created in Ἀρχὰς, <i>i.e.</i> for the
government of day and night; or whether they are to be
regarded as having only that government of day and night
which they discharge by performing the office of illuminating
them, and are not in reality chief of that order of principalities.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Now, when it is said that all things were made by Him,
and that in Him were all things created, both things in
heaven and things on earth, there can be no doubt that also
those things which are in the firmament, which is called
heaven, and in which those luminaries are said to be placed,
are included amongst the number of heavenly things. And
secondly, seeing that the course of the discussion has manifestly
discovered that all things were made or created, and
that amongst created things there is nothing which may not
admit of good and evil, and be capable of either, what are
we to think of the following opinion which certain of our
friends entertain regarding sun, moon, and stars, viz. that
they are unchangeable, and incapable of becoming the
opposite of what they are? Not a few have held that view
even regarding the holy angels, and certain heretics also
regarding souls, which they call spiritual natures.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the first place, then, let us see what reason itself can
discover respecting sun, moon, and stars,—whether the
opinion, entertained by some, of their unchangeableness be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>correct,—and let the declarations of holy Scripture, as far
as possible, be first adduced. For Job appears to assert that
not only may the stars be subject to sin, but even that they
are actually not clean from the contagion of it. The following
are his words: “The stars also are not clean in Thy
sight.”<a id='r132'></a><a href='#f132' class='c007'><sup>[132]</sup></a> Nor is this to be understood of the splendour of
their physical substance, as if one were to say, for example,
of a garment, that it is not clean; for if such were the
meaning, then the accusation of a want of cleanness in the
splendour of their bodily substance would imply an injurious
reflection upon their Creator. For if they are unable, through
their own diligent efforts, either to acquire for themselves a
body of greater brightness, or through their sloth to make
the one they have less pure, how should they incur censure
for being stars that are not clean, if they receive no praise
because they are so?</p>

<p class='c006'>3. But to arrive at a clearer understanding on these
matters, we ought first to inquire after this point, whether
it is allowable to suppose that they are living and rational
beings; then, in the next place, whether their souls came
into existence at the same time with their bodies, or seem to
be anterior to them; and also whether, after the end of the
world, we are to understand that they are to be released from
their bodies; and whether, as we cease to live, so they also
will cease from illuminating the world. Although this inquiry
may seem to be somewhat bold, yet, as we are incited
by the desire of ascertaining the truth as far as possible,
there seems no absurdity in attempting an investigation of
the subject agreeably to the grace of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class='c006'>We think, then, that they may be designated as living
beings, for this reason, that they are said to receive commandments
from God, which is ordinarily the case only with
rational beings. “I have given a commandment to all the
stars,”<a id='r133'></a><a href='#f133' class='c007'><sup>[133]</sup></a> says the Lord. What, now, are these commandments?
Those, namely, that each star, in its order and
course, should bestow upon the world the amount of splendour
which has been entrusted to it. For those which are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>called “planets” move in orbits of one kind, and those which
are termed <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀπλανεῖς</span> are different. Now it manifestly follows
from this, that neither can the movement of that body take
place without a soul, nor can living things be at any time
without motion. And seeing that the stars move with such
order and regularity, that their movements never appear to
be at any time subject to derangement, would it not be the
height of folly to say that so orderly an observance of
method and plan could be carried out or accomplished by
irrational beings? In the writings of Jeremiah, indeed, the
moon is called the queen of heaven.<a id='r134'></a><a href='#f134' class='c007'><sup>[134]</sup></a> Yet if the stars are
living and rational beings, there will undoubtedly appear
among them both an advance and a falling back. For the
language of Job, “the stars are not clean in His sight,” seems
to me to convey some such idea.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. And now we have to ascertain whether those beings
which in the course of the discussion we have discovered
to possess life and reason, were endowed with a soul along
with their bodies at the time mentioned in Scripture, when
“God made two great lights, the greater light to rule the
day, and the lesser light to rule the night, and the stars
also,”<a id='r135'></a><a href='#f135' class='c007'><sup>[135]</sup></a> or whether their spirit was implanted in them, not at
the creation of their bodies, but from without, after they had
been already made. I, for my part, suspect that the spirit
was implanted in them from without; but it will be worth
while to prove this from Scripture: for it will seem an easy
matter to make the assertion on conjectural grounds, while
it is more difficult to establish it by the testimony of Scripture.
Now it may be established conjecturally as follows.
If the soul of a man, which is certainly inferior while it
remains the soul of a man, was not formed along with his
body, but is proved to have been implanted strictly from
without, much more must this be the case with those living
beings which are called heavenly. For, as regards man,
how could the soul of him, viz. Jacob, who supplanted his
brother in the womb, appear to be formed along with his
body? Or how could his soul, or its images, be formed along
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>with his body, who, while lying in his mother’s womb, was
filled with the Holy Ghost? I refer to John leaping in his
mother’s womb, and exulting because the voice of the salutation
of Mary had come to the ears of his mother Elisabeth.
How could his soul and its images be formed along with his
body, who, before he was created in the womb, is said to be
known to God, and was sanctified by Him before his birth?
Some, perhaps, may think that God fills individuals with His
Holy Spirit, and bestows upon them sanctification, not on
grounds of justice and according to their deserts, but undeservedly.
And how shall we escape that declaration: “Is
there unrighteousness with God? God forbid!”<a id='r136'></a><a href='#f136' class='c007'><sup>[136]</sup></a> or this: “Is
there respect of persons with God?”<a id='r137'></a><a href='#f137' class='c007'><sup>[137]</sup></a> For such is the defence
of those who maintain that souls come into existence
with bodies. So far, then, as we can form an opinion from
a comparison with the condition of man, I think it follows
that we must hold the same to hold good with heavenly
beings, which reason itself and scriptural authority show us
to be the case with men.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. But let us see whether we can find in holy Scripture any
indications properly applicable to these heavenly existences.
The following is the statement of the Apostle Paul: “The
creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by
reason of Him who subjected the same in hope, because the
creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of
corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.”<a id='r138'></a><a href='#f138' class='c007'><sup>[138]</sup></a>
To what vanity, pray, was the creature made subject, or what
creature is referred to, or how is it said “not willingly,” or
“in hope of what?” And in what way is the creature itself
to be delivered from the bondage of corruption? Elsewhere,
also, the same apostle says: “For the expectation of the
creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.”<a id='r139'></a><a href='#f139' class='c007'><sup>[139]</sup></a>
And again in another passage, “And not only we, but the
creation itself groaneth together, and is in pain until now.”<a id='r140'></a><a href='#f140' class='c007'><sup>[140]</sup></a>
And hence we have to inquire what are the groanings, and
what are the pains. Let us see then, in the first place, what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>is the vanity to which the creature is subject. I apprehend
that it is nothing else than the body; for although the body
of the stars is ethereal, it is nevertheless material. Whence
also Solomon appears to characterize the whole of corporeal
nature as a kind of burden which enfeebles the vigour of the
soul in the following language: “Vanity of vanities, saith the
Preacher; all is vanity. I have looked, and seen all the works
that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity.”<a id='r141'></a><a href='#f141' class='c007'><sup>[141]</sup></a> To
this vanity, then, is the creature subject, that creature especially
which, being assuredly the greatest in this world, holds
also a distinguished principality of labour, <i>i.e.</i> the sun, and
moon, and stars, are said to be subject to vanity, because they
are clothed with bodies, and set apart to the office of giving
light to the human race. “And this creature,” he remarks,
“was subjected to vanity not willingly.” For it did not
undertake a voluntary service to vanity, but because it was
the will of Him who made it subject, and because of the
promise of the Subjector to those who were reduced to this
unwilling obedience, that when the ministry of their great
work was performed, they were to be freed from this bondage
of corruption and vanity when the time of the glorious redemption
of God’s children should have arrived. And the
whole of creation, receiving this hope, and looking for the
fulfilment of this promise now, in the meantime, as having an
affection for those whom it serves, groans along with them,
and patiently suffers with them, hoping for the fulfilment of
the promises. See also whether the following words of Paul
can apply to those who, although not willingly, yet in accordance
with the will of Him who subjected them, and in hope
of the promises, were made subject to vanity, when he says,
“For I could wish to be dissolved,” or “to return and be
with Christ, which is far better.”<a id='r142'></a><a href='#f142' class='c007'><sup>[142]</sup></a> For I think that the sun
might say in like manner, “I would desire to be dissolved,”
or “to return and be with Christ, which is far better.” Paul
indeed adds, “Nevertheless, to abide in the flesh is more
needful for you;” while the sun may say, “To abide in this
bright and heavenly body is more necessary, on account of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>the manifestation of the sons of God.” The same views are
to be believed and expressed regarding the moon and stars.</p>

<p class='c006'>Let us see now what is the freedom of the creature, or the
termination of its bondage. When Christ shall have delivered
up the kingdom to God even the Father, then also those living
things, when they shall have first been made the kingdom of
Christ, shall be delivered, along with the whole of that kingdom,
to the rule of the Father, that when God shall be all
in all, they also, since they are a part of all things, may have
God in themselves, as He is in all things.</p>

<h4 id='de-principiis-b1-c8' class='c010'>CHAPTER <abbr title='eight'>VIII.</abbr> <br> ON THE ANGELS.</h4>
<p class='c005'>1. A similar method must be followed in treating of the
angels; nor are we to suppose that it is the result of accident
that a particular office is assigned to a particular angel: as
to Raphael, <i>e.g.</i>, the work of curing and healing; to Gabriel,
the conduct of wars; to Michael, the duty of attending to
the prayers and supplications of mortals. For we are not to
imagine that they obtained these offices otherwise than by
their own merits, and by the zeal and excellent qualities which
they severally displayed before this world was formed; so
that afterwards, in the order of archangels, this or that office
was assigned to each one, while others deserved to be enrolled
in the order of angels, and to act under this or that archangel,
or that leader or head of an order. All of which things
were disposed, as I have said, not indiscriminately and fortuitously,
but by a most appropriate and just decision of God,
who arranged them according to deserts, in accordance with
His own approval and judgment: so that to one angel the
church of the Ephesians was to be entrusted; to another,
that of the Smyrnæans; one angel was to be Peter’s, another
Paul’s; and so on through every one of the little ones that
are in the church, for such and such angels as even daily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>behold the face of God must be assigned to each one of
them;<a id='r143'></a><a href='#f143' class='c007'><sup>[143]</sup></a> and there must also be some angel that encampeth
round about them that fear God.<a id='r144'></a><a href='#f144' class='c007'><sup>[144]</sup></a> All of which things,
assuredly, it is to be believed, are not performed by accident
or chance, or because they [the angels] were so created, lest
on that view the Creator should be accused of partiality; but
it is to be believed that they were conferred by God, the just
and impartial Ruler of all things, agreeably to the merits and
good qualities and mental vigour of each individual spirit.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. And now let us say something regarding those who
maintain the existence of a diversity of spiritual natures, that
we may avoid falling into the silly and impious fables of such
as pretend that there is a diversity of spiritual natures both
among heavenly existences and human souls, and for that
reason allege that they were called into being by different
creators; for while it seems, and is really, absurd that to
one and the same creator should be ascribed the creation of
different natures of rational beings, they are nevertheless
ignorant of the cause of that diversity. For they say that it
seems inconsistent for one and the same creator, without
any existing ground of merit, to confer upon some beings the
power of dominion, and to subject others again to authority;
to bestow a principality upon some, and to render others subordinate
to rulers. Which opinions indeed, in my judgment,
are completely rejected by following out the reasoning explained
above, and by which it was shown that the cause of
the diversity and variety among these beings is due to their
conduct, which has been marked either with greater earnestness
or indifference, according to the goodness or badness
of their nature, and not to any partiality on the part of the
Disposer. But that this may more easily be shown to be the
case with heavenly beings, let us borrow an illustration from
what either has been done or is done among men, in order that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>from visible things we may, by way of consequence, behold
also things invisible.</p>

<p class='c006'>Paul and Peter are undoubtedly proved to have been men
of a spiritual nature. When, therefore, Paul is found to
have acted contrary to religion, in having persecuted the
church of God, and Peter to have committed so grave a sin
as, when questioned by the maid-servant, to have asserted
with an oath that he did not know who Christ was, how is
it possible that these—who, according to those persons of
whom we speak, were spiritual beings—should fall into sins
of such a nature, especially as they are frequently in the
habit of saying that a good tree cannot bring forth evil
fruits? And if a good tree cannot produce evil fruit, and
as, according to them, Peter and Paul were sprung from the
root of a good tree, how should they be deemed to have
brought forth fruits so wicked? And if they should return
the answer which is generally invented, that it was not Paul
who persecuted, but some other person, I know not whom,
who was in Paul; and that it was not Peter who uttered
the denial, but some other individual in him; how should
Paul say, if he had not sinned, that “I am not worthy to be
called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God?”<a id='r145'></a><a href='#f145' class='c007'><sup>[145]</sup></a>
Or why did Peter weep most bitterly, if it were another than
he who sinned? From which all their silly assertions will
be proved to be baseless.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. According to our view, there is no rational creature
which is not capable both of good and evil. But it does not
follow, that because we say there is no nature which may
not admit evil, we therefore maintain that every nature has
admitted evil, <i>i.e.</i> has become wicked. As we may say that
the nature of every man admits of his being a sailor, but it
does not follow from that, that every man will become so;
or, again, it is possible for every one to learn grammar or
medicine, but it is not therefore proved that every man is
either a physician or a grammarian; so, if we say that there
is no nature which may not admit evil, it is not necessarily
indicated that it has done so. For, in our view, not even the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>devil himself was incapable of good; but although capable
of admitting good, he did not therefore also desire it, or
make any effort after virtue. For, as we are taught by those
quotations which we adduced from the prophets, there was
once a time when he was good, when he walked in the
paradise of God between the cherubim. As he, then, possessed
the power either of receiving good or evil, but fell
away from a virtuous course, and turned to evil with all the
powers of his mind, so also other creatures, as having a
capacity for either condition, in the exercise of the freedom
of their will, flee from evil, and cleave to good. There is
no nature, then, which may not admit of good or evil, except
the nature of God—the fountain of all good things—and of
Christ; for it is wisdom, and wisdom assuredly cannot admit
folly; and it is righteousness, and righteousness will never
certainly admit of unrighteousness; and it is the Word, or
Reason, which certainly cannot be made irrational; nay, it
is also the light, and it is certain that the darkness does not
receive the light. In like manner, also, the nature of the
Holy Spirit, being holy, does not admit of pollution; for it
is holy by nature, or essential being. If there is any other
nature which is holy, it possesses this property of being made
holy by the reception or inspiration of the Holy Spirit, not
having it by nature, but as an accidental quality, for which
reason it may be lost, in consequence of being accidental.
So also a man may possess an accidental righteousness, from
which it is possible for him to fall away. Even the wisdom
which a man has is still accidental, although it be within
our own power to become wise, if we devote ourselves to
wisdom with the zeal and effort of our life; and if we always
pursue the study of it, we may always be participators of
wisdom: and that result will follow either in a greater or
less degree, according to the desert of our life or the amount
of our zeal. For the goodness of God, as is worthy of Him,
incites and attracts all to that blissful end, where all pain,
and sadness, and sorrow fall away and disappear.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. I am of opinion, then, so far as appears to me, that the
preceding discussion has sufficiently proved that it is neither
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>from want of discrimination, nor from any accidental cause,
either that the “principalities” hold their dominion, or the
other orders of spirits have obtained their respective offices;
but that they have received the steps of their rank on account
of their merits, although it is not our privilege to know or
inquire what those acts of theirs were, by which they earned
a place in any particular order. It is sufficient only to know
this much, in order to demonstrate the impartiality and
righteousness of God, that, conformably with the declaration
of the Apostle Paul, “there is no acceptance of persons
with Him,”<a id='r146'></a><a href='#f146' class='c007'><sup>[146]</sup></a> who rather disposes everything according to the
deserts and moral progress of each individual. So, then,
the angelic office does not exist except as a consequence of
their desert; nor do “powers” exercise power except in virtue
of their moral progress; nor do those which are called “seats,”
<i>i.e.</i> the powers of judging and ruling, administer their powers
unless by merit; nor do “dominions” rule undeservedly, for
that great and distinguished order of rational creatures among
celestial existences is arranged in a glorious variety of offices.
And the same view is to be entertained of those opposing
influences which have given themselves up to such places
and offices, that they derive the property by which they
are made “principalities,” or “powers,” or rulers of the
darkness of the world, or spirits of wickedness, or malignant
spirits, or unclean demons, not from their essential nature,
nor from their being so created, but have obtained these
degrees in evil in proportion to their conduct, and the progress
which they made in wickedness. And that is a second
order of rational creatures, who have devoted themselves to
wickedness in so headlong a course, that they are unwilling
rather than unable to recall themselves; the thirst for evil
being already a passion, and imparting to them pleasure.
But the third order of rational creatures is that of those
who are judged fit by God to replenish the human race, <i>i.e.</i>
the souls of men, assumed in consequence of their moral progress
into the order of angels; of whom we see some assumed
into the number: those, viz., who have been made the sons of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>God, or the children of the resurrection, or who have abandoned
the darkness, and have loved the light, and have been
made children of the light; or those who, proving victorious
in every struggle, and being made men of peace, have been
the sons of peace, and the sons of God; or those who, mortifying
their members on the earth, and, rising above not only
their corporeal nature, but even the uncertain and fragile
movements of the soul itself, have united themselves to the
Lord, being made altogether spiritual, that they may be for
ever one spirit with Him, discerning along with Him each
individual thing, until they arrive at a condition of perfect
spirituality, and discern all things by their perfect illumination
in all holiness through the word and wisdom of God,
and are themselves altogether undistinguishable by any one.</p>

<p class='c006'>We think that those views are by no means to be admitted,
which some are wont unnecessarily to advance and maintain,
viz. that souls descend to such a pitch of abasement
that they forget their rational nature and dignity, and sink
into the condition of irrational animals, either large or small;
and in support of these assertions they generally quote some
pretended statements of Scripture, such as, that a beast, to
which a woman has unnaturally prostituted herself, shall be
deemed equally guilty with the woman, and shall be ordered
to be stoned; or that a bull which strikes with its horns,
shall be put to death in the same way; or even the speaking
of Balaam’s ass, when God opened its mouth, and the dumb
beast of burden, answering with human voice, reproved the
madness of the prophet. All of which assertions we not
only do not receive, but, as being contrary to our belief, we
refute and reject. After the refutation and rejection of such
perverse opinions, we shall show, at the proper time and
place, how those passages which they quote from the sacred
Scriptures ought to be understood.</p>

</div>
<h4 id='de-principiis-b2-c1' class='c009'>CHAPTER <abbr title='one'>I.</abbr> <br> ON THE WORLD.</h4>
<p class='c005'>1. Although all the discussions in the preceding
book have had reference to the world and its
arrangements, it now seems to follow that we
should specially re-discuss a few points respecting
the world itself, <i>i.e.</i> its beginning and end, or those dispensations
of Divine Providence which have taken place
between the beginning and the end, or those events which
are supposed to have occurred before the creation of the
world, or are to take place after the end.</p>

<p class='c006'>In this investigation, the first point which clearly appears
is, that the world in all its diversified and varying conditions
is composed not only of rational and diviner natures, and of
a diversity of bodies, but of dumb animals, wild and tame
beasts, of birds, and of all things which live in the waters;<a id='r148'></a><a href='#f148' class='c007'><sup>[148]</sup></a>
then, secondly, of places, <i>i.e.</i> of the heaven or heavens, and
of the earth or water, as well as of the air, which is intermediate,
and which they term æther, and of everything
which proceeds from the earth or is born in it. Seeing, then,<a id='r149'></a><a href='#f149' class='c007'><sup>[149]</sup></a>
there is so great a variety in the world, and so great a diversity
among rational beings themselves, on account of which
every other variety and diversity also is supposed to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>come into existence, what other cause than this ought to be
assigned for the existence of the world, especially if we have
regard to that end by means of which it was shown in the preceding
book that all things are to be restored to their original
condition? And if this should seem to be logically stated,
what other cause, as we have already said, are we to imagine
for so great a diversity in the world, save the diversity and
variety in the movements and declensions of those who fell
from that primeval unity and harmony in which they were at
first created by God, and who, being driven from that state
of goodness, and drawn in various directions by the harassing
influence of different motives and desires, have changed,
according to their different tendencies, the single and undivided
goodness of their nature into minds of various sorts?<a id='r150'></a><a href='#f150' class='c007'><sup>[150]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>2. But God, by the ineffable skill of His wisdom, transforming
and restoring all things, in whatever manner they are
made, to some useful aim, and to the common advantage of all,
recalls those very creatures which differed so much from each
other in mental conformation to one agreement of labour and
purpose; so that, although they are under the influence of different
motives, they nevertheless complete the fulness and perfection
of one world, and the very variety of minds tends to one
end of perfection. For it is one power which grasps and holds
together all the diversity of the world, and leads the different
movements towards one work, lest so immense an undertaking
as that of the world should be dissolved by the dissensions
of souls. And for this reason we think that God, the Father
of all things, in order to ensure the salvation of all His creatures
through the ineffable plan of His word and wisdom, so
arranged each of these, that every spirit, whether soul or
rational existence, however called, should not be compelled
by force, against the liberty of his own will, to any other
course than that to which the motives of his own mind led
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>him (lest by so doing the power of exercising free-will should
seem to be taken away, which certainly would produce a
change in the nature of the being itself); and that the varying
purposes of these would be suitably and usefully adapted
to the harmony of one world, by some of them requiring
help, and others being able to give it, and others again
being the cause of struggle and contest to those who are
making progress, amongst whom their diligence would be
deemed more worthy of approval, and the place of rank
obtained after victory be held with greater certainty, which
should be established by the difficulties of the contest.<a id='r151'></a><a href='#f151' class='c007'><sup>[151]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>3. Although the whole world is arranged into offices of
different kinds, its condition, nevertheless, is not to be supposed
as one of internal discrepancies and discordances; but
as our one body is provided with many members, and is held
together by one soul, so I am of opinion that the whole world
also ought to be regarded as some huge and immense animal,
which is kept together by the power and reason of God as by
one soul. This also, I think, is indicated in sacred Scripture
by the declaration of the prophet, “Do not I fill heaven and
earth? saith the Lord;”<a id='r152'></a><a href='#f152' class='c007'><sup>[152]</sup></a> and again, “The heaven is my
throne, and the earth is my footstool;”<a id='r153'></a><a href='#f153' class='c007'><sup>[153]</sup></a> and by the Saviour’s
words, when He says that we are to swear “neither by
heaven, for it is God’s throne; nor by the earth, for it is His
footstool.”<a id='r154'></a><a href='#f154' class='c007'><sup>[154]</sup></a> To the same effect also are the words of Paul, in
his address to the Athenians, when he says, “In Him we live,
and move, and have our being.”<a id='r155'></a><a href='#f155' class='c007'><sup>[155]</sup></a> For how do we live, and
move, and have our being in God, except by His comprehending
and holding together the whole world by His power?
And how is heaven the throne of God, and the earth His
footstool, as the Saviour Himself declares, save by His power
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>filling all things both in heaven and earth, according to the
Lord’s own words? And that God, the Father of all things,
fills and holds together the world with the fulness of His
power, according to those passages which we have quoted, no
one, I think, will have any difficulty in admitting. And now,
since the course of the preceding discussion has shown that
the different movements of rational beings, and their varying
opinions, have brought about the diversity that is in the world,
we must see whether it may not be appropriate that this
world should have a termination like its beginning. For
there is no doubt that its end must be sought amid much
diversity and variety; which variety, being found to exist in
the termination of the world, will again furnish ground and
occasion for the diversities of the other world which is to
succeed the present.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. If now, in the course of our discussion, it has been ascertained
that these things are so, it seems to follow that we next
consider the nature of corporeal being, seeing the diversity
in the world cannot exist without bodies. It is evident from
the nature of things themselves, that bodily nature admits of
diversity and variety of change, so that it is capable of undergoing
all possible transformations, as <i>e.g.</i> the conversion of
wood into fire, of fire into smoke, of smoke into air, of oil into
fire. Does not food itself, whether of man or of animals,
exhibit the same ground of change? For whatever we take
as food, is converted into the substance of our body. But
how water is changed into earth or into air, and air again into
fire, or fire into air, or air into water, although not difficult
to explain, yet on the present occasion it is enough merely to
mention them, as our object is to discuss the nature of bodily
matter. By matter, therefore, we understand that which is
placed under bodies, viz. that by which, through the bestowing
and implanting of qualities, bodies exist; and we mention
four qualities—heat, cold, dryness, humidity. These four
qualities being implanted in the ὕλη, or matter (for matter is
found to exist in its own nature without those qualities before
mentioned), produce the different kinds of bodies. Although
this matter is, as we have said above, according to its own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>proper nature without qualities, it is never found to exist
without a quality. And I cannot understand how so many
distinguished men have been of opinion that this matter, which
is so great, and possesses such properties as to enable it to be
sufficient for all the bodies in the world which God willed to
exist, and to be the attendant and slave of the Creator for
whatever forms and species He wished in all things, receiving
into itself whatever qualities He desired to bestow upon it,
was uncreated, <i>i.e.</i> not formed by God Himself, who is the
creator of all things, but that its nature and power were the
result of chance. And I am astonished that they should find
fault with those who deny either God’s creative power or His
providential administration of the world, and accuse them of
impiety for thinking that so great a work as the world could
exist without an architect or overseer; while they themselves
incur a similar charge of impiety in saying that matter is
uncreated, and co-eternal with the uncreated God. According
to this view, then, if we suppose for the sake of argument
that matter did not exist, as these maintain, saying that God
could not create anything when nothing existed, without
doubt He would have been idle, not having matter on which
to operate, which matter they say was furnished Him not by
His own arrangement, but by accident; and they think that
this, which was discovered by chance, was able to suffice Him
for an undertaking of so vast an extent, and for the manifestation
of the power of His might, and by admitting the plan
of all His wisdom, might be distinguished and formed into a
world. Now this appears to me to be very absurd, and to be
the opinion of those men who are altogether ignorant of the
power and intelligence of uncreated nature. But that we
may see the nature of things a little more clearly, let it be
granted that for a little time matter did not exist, and that
God, when nothing formerly existed, caused those things to
come into existence which He desired, why are we to suppose
that God would create matter either better or greater,
or of another kind, than that which He did produce from His
own power and wisdom, in order that that might exist which
formerly did not? Would He create a worse and inferior
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>matter, or one the same as that which they call uncreated?
Now I think it will very easily appear to any one, that neither
a better nor inferior matter could have assumed the forms
and species of the world, if it had not been such as that which
actually did assume them. And does it not then seem impious
to call that uncreated, which, if believed to be formed by God,
would doubtless be found to be such as that which they call
uncreated?</p>

<p class='c006'>5. But that we may believe on the authority of holy Scripture
that such is the case, hear how in the book of Maccabees,
where the mother of seven martyrs exhorts her son to endure
torture, this truth is confirmed; for she says, “I ask of thee,
my son, to look at the heaven and the earth, and at all things
which are in them, and beholding these, to know that God
made all these things when they did not exist.”<a id='r156'></a><a href='#f156' class='c007'><sup>[156]</sup></a> In the book
of the Shepherd also, in the first commandment, he speaks as
follows: “First of all believe that there is one God who
created and arranged all things, and made all things to come
into existence, and out of a state of nothingness.”<a id='r157'></a><a href='#f157' class='c007'><sup>[157]</sup></a> Perhaps
also the expression in the Psalms has reference to this: “He
spake, and they were made; He commanded, and they were
created.”<a id='r158'></a><a href='#f158' class='c007'><sup>[158]</sup></a> For the words, “He spake, and they were made,”
appear to show that the substance of those things which
exist is meant; while the others, “He commanded, and they
were created,” seem spoken of the qualities by which the
substance itself has been moulded.</p>

<h4 id='de-principiis-b2-c2' class='c010'>CHAPTER <abbr title='two'>II.</abbr> <br> ON THE PERPETUITY OF BODILY NATURE.</h4>
<p class='c005'>1. On this topic some are wont to inquire whether, as the
Father generates an uncreated Son, and brings forth a Holy
Spirit, not as if He had no previous existence, but because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>the Father is the origin and source of the Son or Holy Spirit,
and no anteriority or posteriority can be understood as existing
in them; so also a similar kind of union or relationship
can be understood as subsisting between rational natures and
bodily matter. And that this point may be more fully and
thoroughly examined, the commencement of the discussion
is generally directed to the inquiry whether this very bodily
nature, which bears the lives and contains the movements
of spiritual and rational minds, will be equally eternal with
them, or will altogether perish and be destroyed. And that
the question may be determined with greater precision, we
have, in the first place, to inquire if it is possible for rational
natures to remain altogether incorporeal after they have
reached the summit of holiness and happiness (which seems
to me a most difficult and almost impossible attainment), or
whether they must always of necessity be united to bodies.
If, then, any one could show a reason why it was possible
for them to dispense wholly with bodies, it will appear to
follow, that as a bodily nature, created out of nothing after
intervals of time, was produced when it did not exist, so also
it must cease to be when the purposes which it served had
no longer an existence.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. If, however, it is impossible for this point to be at all
maintained, viz. that any other nature than the Father, Son,
and Holy Spirit can live without a body, the necessity of
logical reasoning compels us to understand that rational
natures were indeed created at the beginning, but that
material substance was separated from them only in thought
and understanding, and appears to have been formed for
them, or after them, and that they never have lived nor do
live without it; for an incorporeal life will rightly be considered
a prerogative of the Trinity alone. As we have
remarked above, therefore, that material substance of this
world, possessing a nature admitting of all possible transformations,
is, when dragged down to beings of a lower order,
moulded into the crasser and more solid condition of a body,
so as to distinguish those visible and varying forms of the
world; but when it becomes the servant of more perfect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>and more blessed beings, it shines in the splendour of celestial
bodies, and adorns either the angels of God or the sons of
the resurrection with the clothing of a spiritual body, out
of all which will be filled up the diverse and varying state of
the one world. But if any one should desire to discuss these
matters more fully, it will be necessary, with all reverence
and fear of God, to examine the sacred Scriptures with greater
attention and diligence, to ascertain whether the secret and
hidden sense within them may perhaps reveal anything regarding
these matters; and something may be discovered
in their abstruse and mysterious language, through the demonstration
of the Holy Spirit to those who are worthy, after
many testimonies have been collected on this very point.</p>
<h4 id='de-principiis-b2-c3' class='c010'>CHAPTER <abbr title='three'>III.</abbr> <br> ON THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD, AND ITS CAUSES.</h4>
<p class='c005'>1. The next subject of inquiry is, whether there was any
other world before the one which now exists; and if so,
whether it was such as the present, or somewhat different,
or inferior; or whether there was no world at all, but something
like that which we understand will be after the end of
all things, when the kingdom shall be delivered up to God,
even the Father; which nevertheless may have been the end
of another world,—of that, namely, after which this world
took its beginning; and whether the various lapses of intellectual
natures provoked God to produce this diverse and
varying condition of the world. This point also, I think,
must be investigated in a similar way, viz. whether after this
world there will be any [system of] preservation and amendment,
severe indeed, and attended with much pain to those
who were unwilling to obey the word of God, but a process
through which, by means of instruction and rational training,
those may arrive at a fuller understanding of the truth who
have devoted themselves in the present life to these pursuits,
and who, after having had their minds purified, have advanced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>onwards so as to become capable of attaining divine wisdom;
and after this the end of all things will immediately follow,
and there will be again, for the correction and improvement
of those who stand in need of it, another world, either resembling
that which now exists, or better than it, or greatly
inferior; and how long that world, whatever it be that is to
come after this, shall continue; and if there will be a time
when no world shall anywhere exist, or if there has been a
time when there was no world at all; or if there have been,
or will be several; or if it shall ever come to pass that there
will be one resembling another, like it in every respect, and
indistinguishable from it.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. That it may appear more clearly, then, whether bodily
matter can exist during intervals of time, and whether, as it
did not exist before it was made, so it may again be resolved
into non-existence, let us see, first of all, whether it is possible
for any one to live without a body. For if one person can
live without a body, all things also may dispense with them;
seeing our former treatise has shown that all things tend
towards one end. Now, if all things may exist without bodies,
there will undoubtedly be no bodily substance, seeing there
will be no use for it. But how shall we understand the
words of the apostle in those passages, in which, discussing
the resurrection of the dead, he says, “This corruptible must
put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.
When this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and
this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be
brought to pass the saying which is written, Death is swallowed
up in victory! Where, O death, is thy victory? O
death, thy sting has been swallowed up: the sting of death is
sin, and the strength of sin is the law.”<a id='r159'></a><a href='#f159' class='c007'><sup>[159]</sup></a> Some such meaning,
then, as this seems to be suggested by the apostle. For
can the expression which he employs, “this corruptible,”
and “this mortal,” with the gesture, as it were, of one who
touches or points out, apply to anything else than to bodily
matter? This matter of the body, then, which is now corruptible
shall put on incorruption when a perfect soul, and one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>furnished with the marks<a id='r160'></a><a href='#f160' class='c007'><sup>[160]</sup></a> of incorruption, shall have begun
to inhabit it. And do not be surprised if we speak of a perfect
soul as the clothing of the body (which, on account of
the Word of God and His wisdom, is now named incorruption),
when Jesus Christ Himself, who is the Lord and
Creator of the soul, is said to be the clothing of the saints,
according to the language of the apostle, “Put ye on the
Lord Jesus Christ.”<a id='r161'></a><a href='#f161' class='c007'><sup>[161]</sup></a> As Christ, then, is the clothing of the
soul, so for a kind of reason sufficiently intelligible is the
soul said to be the clothing of the body, seeing it is an ornament
to it, covering and concealing its mortal nature. The
expression, then, “This corruptible must put on incorruption,”
is as if the apostle had said, “This corruptible nature of the
body must receive the clothing of incorruption—a soul possessing
in itself incorruptibility,” because it has been clothed
with Christ, who is the Wisdom and Word of God. But
when this body, which at some future period we shall possess
in a more glorious state, shall have become a partaker of life,
it will then, in addition to being immortal, become also incorruptible.
For whatever is mortal is necessarily also corruptible;
but whatever is corruptible cannot also be said to
be mortal. We say of a stone or a piece of wood that it is
corruptible, but we do not say that it follows that it is also
mortal. But as the body partakes of life, then because life
may be, and is, separated from it, we consequently name it
mortal, and according to another sense also we speak of it as
corruptible. The holy apostle therefore, with remarkable
insight, referring to the general first cause of bodily matter,
of which [matter], whatever be the qualities with which it is
endowed (now indeed carnal, but by and by more refined and
pure, which are termed spiritual), the soul makes constant
use, says, “This corruptible must put on incorruption.” And
in the second place, looking to the special cause of the body,
he says, “This mortal must put on immortality.” Now,
what else will incorruption and immortality be, save the wisdom,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>and the word, and the righteousness of God, which
mould, and clothe, and adorn the soul? And hence it happens
that it is said, “The corruptible will put on incorruption,
and the mortal immortality.” For although we may now
make great proficiency, yet as we only know in part, and
prophesy in part, and see through a glass, darkly, those very
things which we seem to understand, this corruptible does
not yet put on incorruption, nor is this mortal yet clothed
with immortality; and as this training of ours in the body is
protracted doubtless to a longer period, up to the time, viz.,
when those very bodies of ours with which we are enveloped
may, on account of the word of God, and His wisdom and
perfect righteousness, earn incorruptibility and immortality,
therefore is it said, “This corruptible must put on incorruption,
and this mortal must put on immortality.”</p>

<p class='c006'>3. But, nevertheless, those who think that rational creatures
can at any time lead an existence out of the body, may here
raise such questions as the following. If it is true that this
corruptible shall put on incorruption, and this mortal put on
immortality, and that death is swallowed up at the end; this
shows that nothing else than a material nature is to be
destroyed, on which death could operate, while the mental
acumen of those who are in the body seems to be blunted by
the nature of corporeal matter. If, however, they are out of
the body, then they will altogether escape the annoyance arising
from a disturbance of that kind. But as they will not be
able immediately to escape all bodily clothing, they are just to
be considered as inhabiting more refined and purer bodies,
which possess the property of being no longer overcome by
death, or of being wounded by its sting; so that at last, by
the gradual disappearance of the material nature, death is
both swallowed up, and even at the end exterminated, and all
its sting completely blunted by the divine grace which the
soul has been rendered capable of receiving, and has thus
deserved to obtain incorruptibility and immortality. And then
it will be deservedly said by all, “O death, where is thy victory?
O death, where is thy sting? The sting of death is
sin.” If these conclusions, then, seem to hold good, it follows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>that we must believe our condition at some future time to be
incorporeal; and if this is admitted, and all are said to be
subjected to Christ, this [incorporeity] also must necessarily
be bestowed on all to whom the subjection to Christ extends;
since all who are subject to Christ will be in the end subject
to God the Father, to whom Christ is said to deliver up the
kingdom; and thus it appears that then also the need of
bodies will cease.<a id='r162'></a><a href='#f162' class='c007'><sup>[162]</sup></a> And if it ceases, bodily matter returns to
nothing, as formerly also it did not exist.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now let us see what can be said in answer to those who
make these assertions. For it will appear to be a necessary
consequence that, if bodily nature be annihilated, it must be
again restored and created; since it seems a possible thing
that rational natures, from whom the faculty of free-will is
never taken away, may be again subjected to movements of
some kind, through the special act of the Lord Himself, lest
perhaps, if they were always to occupy a condition that was
unchangeable, they should be ignorant that it is by the grace
of God and not by their own merit that they have been
placed in that final state of happiness; and these movements
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>will undoubtedly again be attended by variety and diversity
of bodies, by which the world is always adorned; nor will
it ever be composed [of anything] save of variety and diversity,—an
effect which cannot be produced without a bodily
matter.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. And now I do not understand by what proofs they can
maintain their position, who assert that worlds sometimes
come into existence which are not dissimilar to each other,
but in all respects equal. For if there is said to be a world
similar in all respects [to the present], then it will come to
pass that Adam and Eve will do the same things which they
did before: there will be a second time the same deluge, and
the same Moses will again lead a nation numbering nearly
six hundred thousand out of Egypt; Judas will also a second
time betray the Lord; Paul will a second time keep the garments
of those who stoned Stephen; and everything which
has been done in this life will be said to be repeated,—a state
of things which I think cannot be established by any reasoning,
if souls are actuated by freedom of will, and maintain
either their advance or retrogression according to the power
of their will. For souls are not driven on in a cycle which
returns after many ages to the same round, so as either to
do or desire this or that; but at whatever point the freedom
of their own will aims, thither do they direct the course of
their actions. For what these persons say is much the same
as if one were to assert that if a medimnus of grain were
to be poured out on the ground, the fall of the grain would
be on the second occasion identically the same as on the first,
so that every individual grain would lie for the second time
close beside that grain where it had been thrown before, and
so the medimnus would be scattered in the same order, and
with the same marks as formerly; which certainly is an impossible
result with the countless grains of a medimnus,
even if they were to be poured out without ceasing for many
ages. So therefore it seems to me impossible for a world
to be restored for the second time, with the same order and
with the same amount of births, and deaths, and actions;
but that a diversity of worlds may exist with changes of no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>unimportant kind, so that the state of another world may
be for some unmistakeable reasons better [than this], and for
others worse, and for others again intermediate. But what
may be the number or measure of this I confess myself
ignorant, although, if any one can tell it, I would gladly learn.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. But this world, which is itself called an age, is said to be
the conclusion of many ages. Now the holy apostle teaches
that in that age which preceded this, Christ did not suffer,
nor even in the age which preceded that again; and I know
not that I am able to enumerate the number of anterior ages
in which He did not suffer. I will show, however, from what
statements of Paul I have arrived at this understanding.
He says, “But now once in the consummation of ages, He
was manifested to take away sin by the sacrifice of Himself.”<a id='r163'></a><a href='#f163' class='c007'><sup>[163]</sup></a>
For he says that He was once made a victim, and in the consummation
of ages was manifested to take away sin. Now
that after this age, which is said to be formed for the consummation
of other ages, there will be other ages again to
follow, we have clearly learned from Paul himself, who says,
“That in the ages to come He might show the exceeding
riches of His grace in His kindness towards us.”<a id='r164'></a><a href='#f164' class='c007'><sup>[164]</sup></a> He has
not said, “in the age to come,” nor “in the two ages to
come,” whence I infer that by his language many ages are
indicated. Now if there is something greater than ages, so
that among created beings certain ages may be understood, but
among other beings which exceed and surpass visible creatures,
[ages still greater] (which perhaps will be the case at
the restitution of all things, when the whole universe will come
to a perfect termination), perhaps that period in which the
consummation of all things will take place is to be understood
as something more than an age. But here the authority of
holy Scripture moves me, which says, “For an age and more.”<a id='r165'></a><a href='#f165' class='c007'><sup>[165]</sup></a>
Now this word “more” undoubtedly means something greater
than an age; and see if that expression of the Saviour, “I
will that where I am, these also may be with me; and as I
and Thou are one, these also may be one in us,”<a id='r166'></a><a href='#f166' class='c007'><sup>[166]</sup></a> may not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>seem to convey something more than an age and ages, perhaps
even more than ages of ages,—that period, viz., when all
things are now no longer in an age, but when God is in all.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. Having discussed these points regarding the nature of
the world to the best of our ability, it does not seem out of
place to inquire what is the meaning of the term world,
which in holy Scripture is shown frequently to have different
significations. For what we call in Latin <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>mundus</i></span>, is termed
in Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κόσμος</span>, and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κόσμος</span> signifies not only a world, but
also an ornament. Finally, in Isaiah, where the language of
reproof is directed to the chief daughters of Sion, and where
he says, “Instead of an ornament of a golden head, thou
wilt have baldness on account of thy works,”<a id='r167'></a><a href='#f167' class='c007'><sup>[167]</sup></a> he employs the
same term to denote ornament as to denote the world, viz.
κόσμος. For the plan of the world is said to be contained
in the clothing of the high priest, as we find in the Wisdom
of Solomon, where he says, “For in the long garment was
the whole world.”<a id='r168'></a><a href='#f168' class='c007'><sup>[168]</sup></a> That earth of ours, with its inhabitants,
is also termed the world, as when Scripture says, “The whole
world lieth in wickedness.”<a id='r169'></a><a href='#f169' class='c007'><sup>[169]</sup></a> Clement indeed, a disciple of
the apostles, makes mention of those whom the Greeks called
Ἀντίχθονες, and other parts of the earth, to which no one
of our people can approach, nor can any one of those who
are there cross over to us, which he also termed worlds,
saying, “The ocean is impassable to men; and those are
worlds which are on the other side of it, which are governed
by these same arrangements of the ruling God.”<a id='r170'></a><a href='#f170' class='c007'><sup>[170]</sup></a> That
universe which is bounded by heaven and earth is also called
a world, as Paul declares: “For the fashion of this world
will pass away.”<a id='r171'></a><a href='#f171' class='c007'><sup>[171]</sup></a> Our Lord and Saviour also points out a
certain other world besides this visible one, which it would
indeed be difficult to describe and make known. He says,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>“I am not of this world.”<a id='r172'></a><a href='#f172' class='c007'><sup>[172]</sup></a> For, as if He were of a certain
other world, He says, “I am not of this world.” Now, of
this world we have said beforehand, that the explanation was
difficult; and for this reason, that there might not be afforded
to any an occasion of entertaining the supposition that we
maintain the existence of certain images which the Greeks
call “ideas:” for it is certainly alien to our [writers] to
speak of an incorporeal world existing in the imagination
alone, or in the fleeting world of thoughts; and how they
can assert either that the Saviour comes from thence, or
that the saints will go thither, I do not see. There is no
doubt, however, that something more illustrious and excellent
than this present world is pointed out by the Saviour, at
which He incites and encourages believers to aim. But
whether that world to which He desires to allude be far
separated and divided from this, either by situation, or nature,
or glory; or whether it be superior in glory and quality, but
confined within the limits of this world (which seems to me
more probable), is nevertheless uncertain, and in my opinion
an unsuitable subject for human thought. But from what
Clement seems to indicate when he says, “The ocean is
impassable to men, and those worlds which are behind it,”
speaking in the plural number of the worlds which are behind
it, which he intimates are administered and governed
by the same providence of the Most High God, he appears
to throw out to us some germs of that view by which the
whole universe of existing things, celestial and super-celestial,
earthly and infernal, is generally called one perfect world,
within which, or by which, other worlds, if any there are,
must be supposed to be contained. For which reason he
wished the globe of the sun or moon, and of the other bodies
called planets, to be each termed worlds. Nay, even that
pre-eminent globe itself which they call the non-wandering
(ἀπλανῆ), they nevertheless desire to have properly called
world. Finally, they summon the book of Baruch the
prophet to bear witness to this assertion, because in it the
seven worlds or heavens are more clearly pointed out. Nevertheless,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>above that sphere which they call non-wandering
(ἀπλανῆ), they will have another sphere to exist, which
they say, exactly as our heaven contains all things which are
under it, comprehends by its immense size and indescribable
extent the spaces of all the spheres together within
its more magnificent circumference; so that all things are
within it, as this earth of ours is under heaven. And this
also is believed to be called in the holy Scriptures the good
land, and the land of the living, having its own heaven,
which is higher, and in which the names of the saints are
said to be written, or to have been written, by the Saviour;
by which heaven that earth is confined and shut in, which
the Saviour in the Gospel promises to the meek and merciful.
For they would have this earth of ours, which formerly was
named “Dry,” to have derived its appellation from the
name of that earth, as this heaven also was named firmament
from the title of that heaven. But we have treated at
greater length of such opinions in the place where we had
to inquire into the meaning of the declaration, that in the
beginning “God made the heavens and the earth.” For
another heaven and another earth are shown to exist besides
that “firmament” which is said to have been made after the
second day, or that “dry land” which was afterwards called
“earth.” Certainly, what some say of this world, that it is
corruptible because it was made, and yet is not corrupted,
because the will of God, who made it and holds it together
lest corruption should rule over it, is stronger and more
powerful than corruption, may more correctly be supposed
of that world which we have called above a “non-wandering”
sphere, since by the will of God it is not at all subject to
corruption, for the reason that it has not admitted any
causes of corruption, seeing it is the world of the saints and
of the thoroughly purified, and not of the wicked, like that
world of ours. We must see, moreover, lest perhaps it is
with reference to this that the apostle says, “While we look
not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are
not seen; for the things which are seen are temporal, but
the things which are unseen are eternal. For we know that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we
have a building of God, an house not made with hands,
eternal in the heavens.”<a id='r173'></a><a href='#f173' class='c007'><sup>[173]</sup></a> And when he says elsewhere,
“Because I shall see the heavens, the works of Thy fingers,”<a id='r174'></a><a href='#f174' class='c007'><sup>[174]</sup></a>
and when God said, regarding all things visible, by the mouth
of His prophet, “My hand has formed all these things,”<a id='r175'></a><a href='#f175' class='c007'><sup>[175]</sup></a>
He declares that that eternal house in the heavens which He
promises to His saints was not made with hands, pointing
out, doubtless, the difference of creation in things which are
seen and in those which are not seen. For the same thing
is not to be understood by the expressions, “those things
which are not seen,” and “those things which are invisible.”
For those things which are invisible are not only not seen,
but do not even possess the property of visibility, being what
the Greeks call <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀσώματα</span>, <i>i.e.</i> incorporeal; whereas those of
which Paul says, “They are not seen,” possess indeed the
property of being seen, but, as he explains, are not yet beheld
by those to whom they are promised.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. Having sketched, then, so far as we could understand,
these three opinions regarding the end of all things, and the
supreme blessedness, let each one of our readers determine for
himself, with care and diligence, whether any one of them
can be approved and adopted.<a id='r176'></a><a href='#f176' class='c007'><sup>[176]</sup></a> For it has been said that we
must suppose either that an incorporeal existence is possible,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>after all things have become subject to Christ, and through
Christ to God the Father, when God will be all and in all; or
that when, notwithstanding all things have been made subject
to Christ, and through Christ to God (with whom they formed
also one spirit, in respect of spirits being rational natures),
then the bodily substance itself also being united to most pure
and excellent spirits, and being changed into an ethereal
condition in proportion to the quality or merits of those who
assume it (according to the apostle’s words, “We also shall
be changed”), will shine forth in splendour; or at least that
when the fashion of those things which are seen passes away,
and all corruption has been shaken off and cleansed away,
and when the whole of the space occupied by this world, in
which the spheres of the planets are said to be, has been left
behind and beneath,<a id='r177'></a><a href='#f177' class='c007'><sup>[177]</sup></a> then is reached the fixed abode of the
pious and the good situated above that sphere, which is called
non-wandering (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀπλανής</span>), as in a good land, in a land of the
living, which will be inherited by the meek and gentle; to
which land belongs that heaven (which, with its more magnificent
extent, surrounds and contains that land itself) which
is called truly and chiefly heaven, in which heaven and earth,
the end and perfection of all things, may be safely and most
confidently placed,—where, viz., these, after their apprehension
and their chastisement for the offences which they have
undergone by way of purgation, may, after having fulfilled
and discharged every obligation, deserve a habitation in that
land; while those who have been obedient to the word of
God, and have henceforth by their obedience shown themselves
capable of wisdom, are said to deserve the kingdom
of that heaven or heavens; and thus the prediction is more
worthily fulfilled, “Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit
the earth;”<a id='r178'></a><a href='#f178' class='c007'><sup>[178]</sup></a> and, “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for they
shall inherit the kingdom of heaven;”<a id='r179'></a><a href='#f179' class='c007'><sup>[179]</sup></a> and the declaration
in the Psalm, “He shall exalt thee, and thou shalt inherit
the land.”<a id='r180'></a><a href='#f180' class='c007'><sup>[180]</sup></a> For it is called a descent to this earth, but an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>exaltation to that which is on high. In this way, therefore,
does a sort of road seem to be opened up by the departure of
the saints from that earth to those heavens; so that they do
not so much appear to abide in that land, as to inhabit it with
an intention, viz., to pass on to the inheritance of the kingdom
of heaven, when they have reached that degree of perfection
also.</p>

<h4 id='de-principiis-b2-c4' class='c010'>CHAPTER <abbr title='four'>IV.</abbr> <br> THE GOD OF THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS, AND THE FATHER OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST, IS THE SAME GOD.</h4>
<p class='c005'>1. Having now briefly arranged these points in order as
we best could, it follows that, agreeably to our intention from
the first, we refute those who think that the Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ is a different God from Him who gave the
answers of the law to Moses, or commissioned the prophets,
who is the God of our fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
For in this article of faith, first of all, we must be firmly
grounded. We have to consider, then, the expression of frequent
recurrence in the Gospels, and subjoined to all the acts
of our Lord and Saviour, “that it might be fulfilled which
was spoken by this or that prophet,” it being manifest that
the prophets are the prophets of that God who made the
world. From this therefore we draw the conclusion, that He
who sent the prophets, Himself predicted what was to be
foretold of Christ. And there is no doubt that the Father
Himself, and not another different from Him, uttered these
predictions. The practice, moreover, of the Saviour or His
apostles, frequently quoting illustrations from the Old Testament,
shows that they attribute authority to the ancients. The
injunction also of the Saviour, when exhorting His disciples
to the exercise of kindness, “Be ye perfect, even as your
Father who is in heaven is perfect; for He commands His
sun to rise upon the evil and the good, and sendeth rain on
the just and on the unjust,”<a id='r181'></a><a href='#f181' class='c007'><sup>[181]</sup></a> most evidently suggests even to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>a person of feeble understanding, that He is proposing to the
imitation of His disciples no other God than the maker of
heaven and the bestower of the rain. Again, what else does
the expression, which ought to be used by those who pray,
“Our Father who art in heaven,”<a id='r182'></a><a href='#f182' class='c007'><sup>[182]</sup></a> appear to indicate, save
that God is to be sought in the better parts of the world, <i>i.e.</i>
of His creation? Further, do not those admirable principles
which He lays down respecting oaths, saying that we ought
not to “swear either by heaven, because it is the throne of
God; nor by the earth, because it is His footstool,”<a id='r183'></a><a href='#f183' class='c007'><sup>[183]</sup></a> harmonize
most clearly with the words of the prophet, “Heaven is
my throne, and the earth is my footstool?”<a id='r184'></a><a href='#f184' class='c007'><sup>[184]</sup></a> And also when
casting out of the temple those who sold sheep, and oxen, and
doves, and pouring out the tables of the money-changers,
and saying, “Take these things hence, and do not make my
Father’s house a house of merchandise,”<a id='r185'></a><a href='#f185' class='c007'><sup>[185]</sup></a> He undoubtedly
called Him his Father, to whose name Solomon had raised a
magnificent temple. The words, moreover, “Have ye not
read what was spoken by God to Moses: I am the God of
Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; He
is not a God of the dead, but of the living,”<a id='r186'></a><a href='#f186' class='c007'><sup>[186]</sup></a> most clearly
teach us, that He called the God of the patriarchs (because
they were holy, and were alive) the God of the living, the
same, viz., who had said in the prophets, “I am God, and
besides me there is no God.”<a id='r187'></a><a href='#f187' class='c007'><sup>[187]</sup></a> For if the Saviour, knowing
that He who is written in the law is the God of Abraham,
and that it is the same who says, “I am God, and besides
me there is no God,” acknowledges that very one to be His
Father who is ignorant of the existence of any other God
above Himself, as the heretics suppose, He absurdly declares
Him to be His Father who does not know of a greater God.
But if it is not from ignorance, but from deceit, that He says
there is no other God than Himself, then it is a much greater
absurdity to confess that His Father is guilty of falsehood.
From all which this conclusion is arrived at, that He knows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>of no other Father than God, the Founder and Creator of
all things.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. It would be tedious to collect out of all the passages in
the Gospels the proofs by which the God of the law and of
the Gospels is shown to be one and the same. Let us touch
briefly upon the Acts of the Apostles,<a id='r188'></a><a href='#f188' class='c007'><sup>[188]</sup></a> where Stephen and
the other apostles address their prayers to that God who made
heaven and earth, and who spoke by the mouth of His holy
prophets, calling Him the “God of Abraham, of Isaac, and
of Jacob;” the God who “brought forth His people out of
the land of Egypt.” Which expressions undoubtedly clearly
direct our understandings to faith in the Creator, and implant
an affection for Him in those who have learned piously and
faithfully thus to think of Him; according to the words of
the Saviour Himself, who, when He was asked which was the
greatest commandment in the law, replied, “Thou shalt love
the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,
and with all thy mind. And the second is like unto it,
Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.” And to these
He added: “On these two commandments hang all the law
and the prophets.”<a id='r189'></a><a href='#f189' class='c007'><sup>[189]</sup></a> How is it, then, that He commends to
him whom He was instructing, and was leading to enter on
the office of a disciple, this commandment above all others,
by which undoubtedly love was to be kindled in him towards
the God of that law, inasmuch as such had been declared by
the law in these very words? But let it be granted, notwithstanding
all these most evident proofs, that it is of some other
unknown God that the Saviour says, “Thou shalt love the
Lord thy God with all thy heart,” etc. etc. How, in that
case, if the law and the prophets are, as they say, from the
Creator, <i>i.e.</i> from another God than He whom He calls good,
shall that appear to be logically said which He subjoins, viz.
that “on these two commandments hang the law and the
prophets?” For how shall that which is strange and foreign
to God depend upon Him? And when Paul says, “I thank
my God, whom I serve in my spirit from my forefathers
with pure conscience,”<a id='r190'></a><a href='#f190' class='c007'><sup>[190]</sup></a> he clearly shows that he came not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>to some new God, but to Christ. For what other forefathers
of Paul can be intended, except those of whom he says, “Are
they Hebrews? so am I: are they Israelites? so am I.”<a id='r191'></a><a href='#f191' class='c007'><sup>[191]</sup></a>
Nay, will not the very preface of his Epistle to the Romans
clearly show the same thing to those who know how to understand
the letters of Paul, viz. what God he preaches? For
his words are: “Paul, the servant of Jesus Christ, called to
be an apostle, set apart to the gospel of God, which He had
promised afore by His prophets in the holy Scriptures concerning
His Son, who was made of the seed of David according
to the flesh, and who was declared to be the Son of God with
power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection
from the dead of Christ Jesus our Lord,”<a id='r192'></a><a href='#f192' class='c007'><sup>[192]</sup></a> etc. Moreover,
also the following, “Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of
the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for
oxen? or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our
sakes, no doubt, this is written, that he that plougheth
should plough in hope, and he that thresheth in hope of partaking
of the fruits.”<a id='r193'></a><a href='#f193' class='c007'><sup>[193]</sup></a> By which he manifestly shows that
God, who gave the law on our account, <i>i.e.</i> on account of the
apostles, says, “Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox
that treadeth out the corn;” whose care was not for oxen, but
for the apostles, who were preaching the gospel of Christ.
In other passages also, Paul, embracing the promises of the
law, says, “Honour thy father and thy mother, which is the
first commandment with promise; that it may be well with
thee, and that thy days may be long upon the land, the good
land, which the Lord thy God will give thee.”<a id='r194'></a><a href='#f194' class='c007'><sup>[194]</sup></a> By which
he undoubtedly makes known that the law, and the God of
the law, and His promises, are pleasing to him.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. But as those who uphold this heresy are sometimes
accustomed to mislead the hearts of the simple by certain
deceptive sophisms, I do not consider it improper to bring
forward the assertions which they are in the habit of making,
and to refute their deceit and falsehood. The following,
then, are their declarations. It is written, that “no man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>hath seen God at any time.”<a id='r195'></a><a href='#f195' class='c007'><sup>[195]</sup></a> But that God whom Moses
preaches was both seen by Moses himself, and by his fathers
before him; whereas He who is announced by the Saviour
has never been seen at all by any one. Let us therefore
ask them and ourselves whether they maintain that he whom
they acknowledge to be God, and allege to be a different
God from the Creator, is visible or invisible. And if they
shall say that he is visible, besides being proved to go against
the declaration of Scripture, which says of the Saviour, “He
is the image of the invisible God, the first-born of every
creature,”<a id='r196'></a><a href='#f196' class='c007'><sup>[196]</sup></a> they will fall also into the absurdity of asserting
that God is corporeal. For nothing can be seen except by
help of form, and size, and colour, which are special properties
of bodies. And if God is declared to be a body, then He
will also be found to be material, since every body is composed
of matter. But if He be composed of matter, and
matter is undoubtedly corruptible, then, according to them,
God is liable to corruption! We shall put to them a second
question. Is matter made, or is it uncreated, <i>i.e.</i> not made?
And if they shall answer that it is not made, <i>i.e.</i> uncreated,
we shall ask them if one portion of matter is God, and the
other part the world? But if they shall say of matter that
it is made, it will undoubtedly follow that they confess Him
whom they declare to be God to have been made!—a result
which certainly neither their reason nor ours can admit.
But they will say, God is invisible. And what will you do?
If you say that He is invisible by nature, then neither ought
He to be visible to the Saviour. Whereas, on the contrary,
God, the Father of Christ, is said to be seen, because “he
who sees the Son,” he says, “sees also the Father.”<a id='r197'></a><a href='#f197' class='c007'><sup>[197]</sup></a> This
certainly would press us very hard, were the expression not
understood by us more correctly of understanding, and not
of seeing. For he who has understood the Son will understand
the Father also. In this way, then, Moses too must
be supposed to have seen God, not beholding Him with the
bodily eye, but understanding Him with the vision of the
heart and the perception of the mind, and that only in some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>degree. For it is manifest that He, viz., who gave answers
to Moses, said, “You shall not see my face, but my hinder
parts.”<a id='r198'></a><a href='#f198' class='c007'><sup>[198]</sup></a> These words are, of course, to be understood in
that mystical sense which is befitting divine words, those old
wives’ fables being rejected and despised which are invented
by ignorant persons respecting the anterior and posterior
parts of God. Let no one indeed suppose that we have
indulged any feeling of impiety in saying that even to the
Saviour the Father is not visible. Let him consider the
distinction which we employ in dealing with heretics. For
we have explained that it is one thing to see and to be seen,
and another to know and to be known, or to understand
and to be understood.<a id='r199'></a><a href='#f199' class='c007'><sup>[199]</sup></a> To see, then, and to be seen, is a
property of bodies, which certainly will not be appropriately
applied either to the Father, or to the Son, or to the Holy
Spirit, in their mutual relations with one another. For the
nature of the Trinity surpasses the measure of vision, granting
to those who are in the body, <i>i.e.</i> to all other creatures,
the property of vision in reference to one another. But to a
nature that is incorporeal and for the most part intellectual,
no other attribute is appropriate save that of knowing or
being known, as the Saviour Himself declares when He says,
“No man knoweth the Son, save the Father; nor does any
one know the Father, save the Son, and he to whom the
Son will reveal Him.”<a id='r200'></a><a href='#f200' class='c007'><sup>[200]</sup></a> It is clear, then, that He has not
said, “No one has seen the Father, save the Son;” but, “No
one knoweth the Father, save the Son.”</p>

<p class='c006'>4. And now, if, on account of those expressions which occur
in the Old Testament, as when God is said to be angry or
to repent, or when any other human affection or passion is
described, [our opponents] think that they are furnished with
grounds for refuting us, who maintain that God is altogether
impassible, and is to be regarded as wholly free from all
affections of that kind, we have to show them that similar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>statements are found even in the parables of the Gospel; as
when it is said, that he who planted a vineyard, and let it
out to husbandmen, who slew the servants that were sent to
them, and at last put to death even the son, is said in anger
to have taken away the vineyard from them, and to have
delivered over the wicked husbandmen to destruction, and to
have handed over the vineyard to others, who would yield
him the fruit in its season. And so also with regard to those
citizens who, when the head of the household had set out
to receive for himself a kingdom, sent messengers after him,
saying, “We will not have this man to reign over us;”<a id='r201'></a><a href='#f201' class='c007'><sup>[201]</sup></a> for
the head of the household having obtained the kingdom,
returned, and in anger commanded them to be put to death
before him, and burned their city with fire. But when we
read either in the Old Testament or in the New of the anger
of God, we do not take such expressions literally, but seek in
them a spiritual meaning, that we may think of God as He
deserves to be thought of. And on these points, when expounding
the verse in the second Psalm, “Then shall He
speak to them in His anger, and trouble them in His fury,”<a id='r202'></a><a href='#f202' class='c007'><sup>[202]</sup></a>
we showed, to the best of our poor ability, how such an
expression ought to be understood.</p>

<h4 id='de-principiis-b2-c5' class='c010'>CHAPTER <abbr title='five'>V.</abbr> <br> ON JUSTICE AND GOODNESS.</h4>
<p class='c005'>1. Now, since this consideration has weight with some, that
the leaders of that heresy (of which we have been speaking)
think they have established a kind of division, according to
which they have declared that justice is one thing and goodness
another, and have applied this division even to divine
things, maintaining that the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ
is indeed a good God, but not a just one, whereas the God
of the law and the prophets is just, but not good; I think
it necessary to return, with as much brevity as possible, an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>answer to these statements. These persons, then, consider
goodness to be some such affection as would have benefits
conferred on all, although the recipient of them be unworthy
and undeserving of any kindness; but here, in my opinion,
they have not rightly applied their definition, inasmuch as
they think that no benefit is conferred on him who is visited
with any suffering or calamity. Justice, on the other hand,
they view as that quality which rewards every one according
to his deserts. But here, again, they do not rightly interpret
the meaning of their own definition. For they think that it
is just to send evils upon the wicked and benefits upon the
good; <i>i.e.</i> so that, according to their view, the just God does
not appear to wish well to the bad, but to be animated by a
kind of hatred against them. And they gather together instances
of this, wherever they find a history in the Scriptures of
the Old Testament, relating, <i>e.g.</i>, the punishment of the deluge,
or the fate of those who are described as perishing in it, or
the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrha by a shower of fire
and brimstone, or the falling of all the people in the wilderness
on account of their sins, so that none of those who had
left Egypt were found to have entered the promised land,
with the exception of Joshua and Caleb. Whereas from the
New Testament they gather together words of compassion
and piety, through which the disciples are trained by the
Saviour, and by which it seems to be declared that no one is
good save God the Father only; and by this means they
have ventured to style the Father of the Saviour Jesus Christ
a good God, but to say that the God of the world is a different
one, whom they are pleased to term just, but not also
good.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Now I think they must, in the first place, be required
to show, if they can, agreeably to their own definition, that
the Creator is just in punishing according to their deserts,
either those who perished at the time of the deluge, or the
inhabitants of Sodom, or those who had quitted Egypt, seeing
we sometimes behold committed crimes more wicked and
detestable than those for which the above-mentioned persons
were destroyed, while we do not yet see every sinner paying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>the penalty of his misdeeds. Will they say that He who at
one time was just has been made good? Or will they rather
be of opinion that He is even now just, but is patiently
enduring human offences, while that then He was not even
just, inasmuch as He exterminated innocent and sucking
children along with cruel and ungodly giants? Now, such
are their opinions, because they know not how to understand
anything beyond the letter; otherwise they would
show how it is literal justice for sins to be visited upon the
heads of children to the third and fourth generation, and on
children’s children after them. By us, however, such things
are not understood literally; but, as Ezekiel taught<a id='r203'></a><a href='#f203' class='c007'><sup>[203]</sup></a> when
relating the parable, we inquire what is the inner meaning
contained in the parable itself. Moreover, they ought to
explain this also, how He is just, and rewards every one
according to his merits, who punishes earthly-minded persons
and the devil, seeing they have done nothing worthy of
punishment. For they could not do any good if, according
to them, they were of a wicked and ruined nature. For as
they style Him a judge, He appears to be a judge not so
much of actions as of natures; and if a bad nature cannot
do good, neither can a good nature do evil. Then, in the
next place, if He whom they call good is good to all, He is
undoubtedly good also to those who are destined to perish.
And why does He not save them? If He does not desire to
do so, He will be no longer good; if He does desire it, and
cannot effect it, He will not be omnipotent. Why do they
not rather hear the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ in the
Gospels, preparing fire for the devil and his angels? And
how shall that proceeding, as penal as it is sad, appear to be,
according to their view, the work of the good God? Even
the Saviour Himself, the Son of the good God, protests in
the Gospels, and declares that “if signs and wonders had been
done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented<a id='r204'></a><a href='#f204' class='c007'><sup>[204]</sup></a> long
ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.” And when He had come
near to those very cities, and had entered their territory,
why, pray, does He avoid entering those cities, and exhibiting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>to them abundance of signs and wonders, if it were certain
that they would have repented, after they had been performed,
in sackcloth and ashes? But as He does not do this, He
undoubtedly abandons to destruction those whom the language
of the Gospel shows not to have been of a wicked or ruined
nature, inasmuch as it declares they were capable of repentance.
Again, in a certain parable of the Gospel, where
the king enters in to see the guests reclining at the banquet,
he beheld a certain individual not clothed with wedding
raiment, and said to him, “Friend, how camest thou in hither,
not having a wedding garment?” and then ordered his
servants, “Bind him hand and foot, and cast him into outer
darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”<a id='r205'></a><a href='#f205' class='c007'><sup>[205]</sup></a>
Let them tell us who is that king who entered in to see the
guests, and finding one amongst them with unclean garments,
commanded him to be bound by his servants, and thrust out
into outer darkness. Is he the same whom they call just?
How then had he commanded good and bad alike to be invited,
without directing their merits to be inquired into by
his servants? By such procedure would be indicated, not
the character of a just God who rewards according to men’s
deserts, as they assert, but of one who displays undiscriminating
goodness towards all. Now, if this must necessarily be
understood of the good God, <i>i.e.</i> either of Christ or of the
Father of Christ, what other objection can they bring against
the justice of God’s judgment? Nay, what else is there so
unjust charged by them against the God of the law as to order
him who had been invited by His servants, whom He had sent
to call good and bad alike, to be bound hand and foot, and
to be thrown into outer darkness, because he had on unclean
garments?</p>

<p class='c006'>3. And now, what we have drawn from the authority
of Scripture ought to be sufficient to refute the arguments
of the heretics. It will not, however, appear improper if we
discuss the matter with them shortly, on the grounds of reason
itself. We ask them, then, if they know what is regarded
among men as the ground of virtue and wickedness, and if it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>appears to follow that we can speak of virtues in God, or, as
they think, in these two Gods. Let them give an answer
also to the question, whether they consider goodness to be a
virtue; and as they will undoubtedly admit it to be so, what
will they say of injustice? They will never certainly, in my
opinion, be so foolish as to deny that justice is a virtue. Accordingly,
if virtue is a blessing, and justice is a virtue, then
without doubt justice is goodness. But if they say that
justice is not a blessing, it must either be an evil or an indifferent
thing. Now I think it folly to return any answer
to those who say that justice is an evil, for I shall have the
appearance of replying either to senseless words, or to men
out of their minds. How can that appear an evil which is
able to reward the good with blessings, as they themselves
also admit? But if they say that it is a thing of indifference,
it follows that since justice is so, sobriety also, and prudence,
and all the other virtues, are things of indifference. And
what answer shall we make to Paul, when he says, “If there
be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things,
which ye have learned, and received, and heard, and seen in
me?”<a id='r206'></a><a href='#f206' class='c007'><sup>[206]</sup></a> Let them learn, therefore, by searching the holy
Scriptures, what are the individual virtues, and not deceive
themselves by saying that that God who rewards every one
according to his merits, does, through hatred of evil, recompense
the wicked with evil, and not because those who have
sinned need to be treated with severer remedies, and because
He applies to them those measures which, with the prospect
of improvement, seem nevertheless, for the present, to produce
a feeling of pain. They do not read what is written
respecting the hope of those who were destroyed in the deluge;
of which hope Peter himself thus speaks in his first epistle:
“That Christ, indeed, was put to death in the flesh, but
quickened by the Spirit, by which He went and preached to
the spirits who were kept in prison, who once were unbelievers,
when they awaited the long-suffering of God in the days of
Noah, when the ark was preparing, in which a few, <i>i.e.</i> eight
souls, were saved by water. Whereunto also baptism by a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>like figure now saves you.”<a id='r207'></a><a href='#f207' class='c007'><sup>[207]</sup></a> And with regard to Sodom and
Gomorrha, let them tell us whether they believe the prophetic
words to be those of the Creator God—of Him, viz.,
who is related to have rained upon them a shower of fire and
brimstone. What does Ezekiel the prophet say of them?
“Sodom,” he says, “shall be restored to her former condition.”<a id='r208'></a><a href='#f208' class='c007'><sup>[208]</sup></a>
But why, in afflicting those who are deserving of
punishment, does He not afflict them for their good?—who
also says to Chaldea, “Thou hast coals of fire, sit upon them;
they will be a help to thee.”<a id='r209'></a><a href='#f209' class='c007'><sup>[209]</sup></a> And of those also who fell in
the desert, let them hear what is related in the seventy-eighth
Psalm, which bears the superscription of Asaph; for he
says, “When He slew them, then they sought Him.”<a id='r210'></a><a href='#f210' class='c007'><sup>[210]</sup></a> He
does not say that some sought Him after others had been
slain, but he says that the destruction of those who were
killed was of such a nature that, when put to death, they
sought God. By all which it is established, that the God of
the law and the Gospels is one and the same, a just and good
God, and that He confers benefits justly, and punishes with
kindness; since neither goodness without justice, nor justice
without goodness, can display the [real] dignity of the divine
nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>We shall add the following remarks, to which we are driven
by their subtleties. If justice is a different thing from goodness,
then, since evil is the opposite of good, and injustice
of justice, injustice will doubtless be something else than an
evil; and as, in your opinion, the just man is not good, so
neither will the unjust man be wicked; and again, as the good
man is not just, so the wicked man also will not be unjust.
But who does not see the absurdity, that to a good God one
should be opposed that is evil; while to a just God, whom they
allege to be inferior to the good, no one should be opposed!
For there is none who can be called unjust, as there is a
Satan who is called wicked. What, then, are we to do? Let
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>us give up the position which we defend, for they will not be
able to maintain that a bad man is not also unjust, and an
unjust man wicked. And if these qualities be indissolubly
inherent in these opposites, viz. injustice in wickedness, or
wickedness in injustice, then unquestionably the good man
will be inseparable from the just man, and the just from the
good; so that, as we speak of one and the same wickedness
in malice and injustice, we may also hold the virtue of goodness
and justice to be one and the same.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. They again recall us, however, to the words of Scripture,
by bringing forward that celebrated question of theirs,
affirming that it is written, “A bad tree cannot produce good
fruits; for a tree is known by its fruit.”<a id='r211'></a><a href='#f211' class='c007'><sup>[211]</sup></a> What, then, is
their position? What sort of tree the law is, is shown by its
fruits, <i>i.e.</i> by the language of its precepts. For if the law
be found to be good, then undoubtedly He who gave it is
believed to be a good God. But if it be just rather than
good, then God also will be considered a just legislator. The
Apostle Paul makes use of no circumlocution, when he says,
“The law is good; and the commandment is holy, and just,
and good.”<a id='r212'></a><a href='#f212' class='c007'><sup>[212]</sup></a> From which it is clear that Paul had not learned
the language of those who separate justice from goodness,
but had been instructed by that God, and illuminated by His
Spirit, who is at the same time both holy, and good, and just;
and speaking by whose Spirit he declared that the commandment
of the law was holy, and just, and good. And that he
might show more clearly that goodness was in the commandment
to a greater degree than justice and holiness, repeating
his words, he used, instead of these three epithets, that of
goodness alone, saying, “Was then that which is good made
death unto me? God forbid.”<a id='r213'></a><a href='#f213' class='c007'><sup>[213]</sup></a> As he knew that goodness
was the <i>genus</i> of the virtues, and that justice and holiness were
<i>species</i> belonging to the <i>genus</i>, and having in the former
verses named <i>genus</i> and <i>species</i> together, he fell back, when
repeating his words, on the <i>genus</i> alone. But in those which
follow he says, “Sin wrought death in me by that which is
good,” where he sums up generically what he had beforehand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>explained specifically. And in this way also is to be
understood the declaration, “A good man, out of the good
treasure of his heart, bringeth forth good things; and an
evil man, out of the evil treasure, bringeth forth evil
things.”<a id='r214'></a><a href='#f214' class='c007'><sup>[214]</sup></a> For here also he assumed that there was a <i>genus</i>
in good or evil, pointing out unquestionably that in a good
man there were both justice, and temperance, and prudence,
and piety, and everything that can be either called or understood
to be good. In like manner also he said that a man
was wicked who should without any doubt be unjust, and
impure, and unholy, and everything which singly makes a
bad man. For as no one considers a man to be wicked without
these marks of wickedness (nor indeed can he be so), so
also it is certain that without these virtues no one will be
deemed to be good. There still remains to them, however,
that saying of the Lord in the Gospel, which they think is
given them in a special manner as a shield, viz. “There is
none good but one, God the Father.”<a id='r215'></a><a href='#f215' class='c007'><sup>[215]</sup></a> This word they declare
is peculiar to the Father of Christ, who, however, is
different from the God who is Creator of all things, to which
Creator he gave no appellation of goodness. Let us see now
if, in the Old Testament, the God of the prophets and the
Creator and Legislator of the world is not called good.
What are the expressions which occur in the Psalms? “How
good is God to Israel, to the upright in heart!”<a id='r216'></a><a href='#f216' class='c007'><sup>[216]</sup></a> and, “Let
Israel now say that He is good, that His mercy endureth for
ever;”<a id='r217'></a><a href='#f217' class='c007'><sup>[217]</sup></a> the language in the Lamentations of Jeremiah,
“The Lord is good to them that wait for Him, to the soul
that seeketh Him.”<a id='r218'></a><a href='#f218' class='c007'><sup>[218]</sup></a> As therefore God is frequently called
good in the Old Testament, so also the Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ is styled just in the Gospels. Finally, in the
Gospel according to John, our Lord Himself, when praying
to the Father, says, “O just Father, the world hath not
known Thee.”<a id='r219'></a><a href='#f219' class='c007'><sup>[219]</sup></a> And lest perhaps they should say that it
was owing to His having assumed human flesh that He called
the Creator of the world “Father,” and styled Him “Just,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>they are excluded from such a refuge by the words that immediately
follow, “The world hath not known Thee.” But,
according to them, the world is ignorant of the good God
alone. For the world unquestionably recognises its Creator,
the Lord Himself saying that the world loveth what is its
own. Clearly, then, He whom they consider to be the good
God, is called just in the Gospels. Any one may at leisure
gather together a greater number of proofs, consisting of
those passages, where in the New Testament the Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ is called just, and in the Old also,
where the Creator of heaven and earth is called good; so
that the heretics, being convicted by numerous testimonies,
may perhaps some time be put to the blush.</p>

<h4 id='de-principiis-b2-c6' class='c010'>CHAPTER <abbr title='six'>VI.</abbr> <br> ON THE INCARNATION OF CHRIST.</h4>
<p class='c005'>1. It is now time, after this cursory notice of these points,
to resume our investigation of the incarnation of our Lord
and Saviour, viz. how or why He became man. Having
therefore, to the best of our feeble ability, considered His
divine nature from the contemplation of His own works
rather than from our own feelings, and having nevertheless
beheld (with the eye) His visible creation while the invisible
creation is seen by faith, because human frailty can neither
see all things with the bodily eye nor comprehend them by
reason, seeing we men are weaker and frailer than any other
rational beings (for those which are in heaven, or are supposed
to exist above the heaven, are superior), it remains that we
seek a being intermediate between all created things and
God, <i>i.e.</i> a Mediator, whom the Apostle Paul styles the “first-born
of every creature.”<a id='r220'></a><a href='#f220' class='c007'><sup>[220]</sup></a> Seeing, moreover, those declarations
regarding His majesty which are contained in holy
Scripture, that He is called the “image of the invisible God,
and the first-born of every creature,” and that “in Him were
all things created, visible and invisible, whether they be
thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers, all things
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>were created by Him, and in Him: and He is before all
things, and by Him all things consist,”<a id='r221'></a><a href='#f221' class='c007'><sup>[221]</sup></a> who is the head of
all things, alone having as head God the Father; for it is
written, “The head of Christ is God;”<a id='r222'></a><a href='#f222' class='c007'><sup>[222]</sup></a> seeing clearly also
that it is written, “No one knoweth the Father, save the
Son, nor doth any one know the Son, save the Father”<a id='r223'></a><a href='#f223' class='c007'><sup>[223]</sup></a>
(for who can know what wisdom is, save He who called
it into being? Or who can understand clearly what truth
is, save the Father of truth? Who can investigate with
certainty the universal nature of His Word, and of God
Himself, which nature proceeds from God, except God alone,
with whom the Word was), we ought to regard it as certain
that this Word, or Reason (if it is to be so termed),
this Wisdom, this Truth, is known to no other than the
Father only; and of Him it is written, that “I do not think
that the world itself could contain the books which might be
written,”<a id='r224'></a><a href='#f224' class='c007'><sup>[224]</sup></a> regarding, viz., the glory and majesty of the Son
of God. For it is impossible to commit to writing [all] those
particulars which belong to the glory of the Saviour. After
the consideration of questions of such importance concerning
the being of the Son of God, we are lost in the deepest
amazement that such a nature, pre-eminent above all others,
should have divested itself of its condition of majesty and
become man, and tabernacled amongst men, as the grace that
was poured upon His lips testifies, and as His heavenly Father
bore Him witness, and as is confessed by the various signs
and wonders and miracles<a id='r225'></a><a href='#f225' class='c007'><sup>[225]</sup></a> that were performed by Him;
who also, before that appearance of His which He manifested
in the body, sent the prophets as His forerunners, and the
messengers of His advent; and after His ascension into
heaven, made His holy apostles, men ignorant and unlearned,
taken from the ranks of tax-gatherers or fishermen, but who
were filled with the power of His divinity, to itinerate throughout
the world, that they might gather together out of every race
and every nation a multitude of devout believers in Himself.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. But of all the marvellous and mighty acts related of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>Him, this altogether surpasses human admiration, and is
beyond the power of mortal frailness to understand or feel,
how that mighty power of divine majesty, that very Word
of the Father, and that very wisdom of God, in which were
created all things, visible and invisible, can be believed to
have existed within the limits of that man who appeared in
Judea; nay, that the Wisdom of God can have entered the
womb of a woman, and have been born an infant, and have
uttered wailings like the cries of little children! And that
afterwards it should be related that He was greatly troubled
in death, saying, as He Himself declared, “My soul is sorrowful,
even unto death;”<a id='r226'></a><a href='#f226' class='c007'><sup>[226]</sup></a> and that at the last He was
brought to that death which is accounted the most shameful
among men, although He rose again on the third day. Since,
then, we see in Him some things so human that they appear to
differ in no respect from the common frailty of mortals, and
some things so divine that they can appropriately belong to
nothing else than to the primal and ineffable nature of Deity,
the narrowness of human understanding can find no outlet;
but, overcome with the amazement of a mighty admiration,
knows not whither to withdraw, or what to take hold of, or
whither to turn. If it think of a God, it sees a mortal; if it
think of a man, it beholds Him returning from the grave,
after overthrowing the empire of death, laden with its spoils.
And therefore the spectacle is to be contemplated with all
fear and reverence, that the truth of both natures may be
clearly shown to exist in one and the same Being; so that
nothing unworthy or unbecoming may be perceived in that
divine and ineffable substance, nor yet those things which
were done be supposed to be the illusions of imaginary appearances.
To utter these things in human ears, and to explain
them in words, far surpasses the powers either of our rank, or
of our intellect and language. I think that it surpasses the
power even of the holy apostles; nay, the explanation of that
mystery may perhaps be beyond the grasp of the entire creation
of celestial powers. Regarding Him, then, we shall state, in
the fewest possible words, the contents of our creed rather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>than the assertions which human reason is wont to advance;
and this from no spirit of rashness, but as called for by the
nature of our arrangement, laying before you rather [what
may be termed] our suspicions than any clear affirmations.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. The Only-begotten of God, therefore, through whom,
as the previous course of the discussion has shown, all things
were made, visible and invisible, according to the view of
Scripture, both made all things, and loves what He made.
For since He is Himself the invisible image of the invisible
God, He conveyed invisibly a share in Himself to all His
rational creatures, so that each one obtained a part of Him
exactly proportioned to the amount of affection with which
he regarded Him. But since, agreeably to the faculty of free-will,
variety and diversity characterized the individual souls,
so that one was attached with a warmer love to the Author of
its being, and another with a feebler and weaker regard, that
soul (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>anima</i></span>) regarding which Jesus said, “No one shall take
my life (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>animam</i></span>) from me,”<a id='r227'></a><a href='#f227' class='c007'><sup>[227]</sup></a> inhering, from the beginning
of the creation, and afterwards, inseparably and indissolubly
in Him, as being the Wisdom and Word of God, and the
Truth and the true Light, and receiving Him wholly, and
passing into His light and splendour, was made with Him
in a pre-eminent degree<a id='r228'></a><a href='#f228' class='c007'><sup>[228]</sup></a> one spirit, according to the promise
of the apostle to those who ought to imitate it, that “he
who is joined in the Lord is one spirit.”<a id='r229'></a><a href='#f229' class='c007'><sup>[229]</sup></a> This substance of
a soul, then, being intermediate between God and the flesh—it
being impossible for the nature of God to intermingle
with a body without an intermediate instrument—the God-man
is born, as we have said, that substance being the intermediary
to whose nature it was not contrary to assume a
body. But neither, on the other hand, was it opposed to the
nature of that soul, as a rational existence, to receive God,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>into whom, as stated above, as into the Word, and the Wisdom,
and the Truth, it had already wholly entered. And therefore
deservedly is it also called, along with the flesh which it
had assumed, the Son of God, and the Power of God, the
Christ, and the Wisdom of God, either because it was wholly
in the Son of God, or because it received the Son of God
wholly into itself. And again, the Son of God, through
whom all things were created, is named Jesus Christ and
the Son of man. For the Son of God also is said to have
died—in reference, viz., to that nature which could admit of
death; and He is called the Son of man, who is announced
as about to come in the glory of God the Father, with the
holy angels. And for this reason, throughout the whole of
Scripture, not only is the divine nature spoken of in human
words, but the human nature is adorned by appellations of
divine dignity. More truly indeed of this than of any other
can the statement be affirmed, “They shall both be in one
flesh, and are no longer two, but one flesh.”<a id='r230'></a><a href='#f230' class='c007'><sup>[230]</sup></a> For the Word
of God is to be considered as being more in one flesh with
the soul than a man with his wife. But to whom is it more
becoming to be also one spirit with God, than to this soul
which has so joined itself to God by love as that it may justly
be said to be one spirit with Him?</p>

<p class='c006'>4. That the perfection of his love and the sincerity of his
deserved affection<a id='r231'></a><a href='#f231' class='c007'><sup>[231]</sup></a> formed for it this inseparable union with
God, so that the assumption of that soul was not accidental,
or the result of a personal preference, but was conferred as
the reward of its virtues, listen to the prophet addressing it
thus: “Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated wickedness:
therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of
gladness above thy fellows.”<a id='r232'></a><a href='#f232' class='c007'><sup>[232]</sup></a> As a reward for its love, then,
it is anointed with the oil of gladness; <i>i.e.</i> the soul of Christ
along with the Word of God is made Christ. Because to be
anointed with the oil of gladness means nothing else than to
be filled with the Holy Spirit. And when it is said “above
thy fellows,” it is meant that the grace of the Spirit was not
given to it as to the prophets, but that the essential fulness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>of the Word of God Himself was in it, according to the saying
of the apostle, “In whom dwelt all the fulness of the
Godhead bodily.”<a id='r233'></a><a href='#f233' class='c007'><sup>[233]</sup></a> Finally, on this account he has not only
said, “Thou hast loved righteousness;” but he adds, “and
Thou hast hated wickedness.” For to have hated wickedness
is what the Scripture says of Him, that “He did no sin,
neither was any guile found in His mouth,”<a id='r234'></a><a href='#f234' class='c007'><sup>[234]</sup></a> and that “He
was tempted in all things like as we are, without sin.”<a id='r235'></a><a href='#f235' class='c007'><sup>[235]</sup></a> Nay,
the Lord Himself also said, “Which of you will convince
me of sin?”<a id='r236'></a><a href='#f236' class='c007'><sup>[236]</sup></a> And again He says with reference to Himself,
“Behold, the prince of this world cometh, and findeth nothing
in me.”<a id='r237'></a><a href='#f237' class='c007'><sup>[237]</sup></a> All which [passages] show that in Him there was
no sense of sin; and that the prophet might show more
clearly that no sense of sin had ever entered into Him, he
says, “Before the boy could have knowledge to call upon
father or mother, He turned away from wickedness.”<a id='r238'></a><a href='#f238' class='c007'><sup>[238]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>5. Now, if our having shown above that Christ possessed a
rational soul should cause a difficulty to any one, seeing we
have frequently proved throughout all our discussions that
the nature of souls is capable both of good and evil, the
difficulty will be explained in the following way. That the
nature, indeed, of His soul was the same as that of all others
cannot be doubted, otherwise it could not be called a soul
were it not truly one. But since the power of choosing good
and evil is within the reach of all, this soul which belonged
to Christ elected to love righteousness, so that in proportion
to the immensity of its love it clung to it unchangeably and
inseparably, so that firmness of purpose, and immensity of
affection, and an inextinguishable warmth of love, destroyed
all susceptibility (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sensum</i></span>) for alteration and change; and that
which formerly depended upon the will was changed by the
power of long custom into nature; and so we must believe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>that there existed in Christ a human and rational soul, without
supposing that it had any feeling or possibility of sin.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. To explain the matter more fully, it will not appear
absurd to make use of an illustration, although on a subject
of so much difficulty it is not easy to obtain suitable illustrations.
However, if we may speak without offence, the metal
iron is capable of cold and heat. If, then, a mass of iron be
kept constantly in the fire, receiving the heat through all its
pores and veins, and the fire being continuous and the iron
never removed from it, it become wholly converted into the
latter; could we at all say of this, which is by nature a mass
of iron, that when placed in the fire, and incessantly burning,
it was at any time capable of admitting cold? On the contrary,
because it is more consistent with truth, do we not
rather say, what we often see happening in furnaces, that it
has become wholly fire, seeing nothing but fire is visible in
it? And if any one were to attempt to touch or handle it,
he would experience the action not of iron, but of fire. In
this way, then, that soul which, like an iron in the fire, has
been perpetually placed in the Word, and perpetually in the
Wisdom, and perpetually in God,<a id='r239'></a><a href='#f239' class='c007'><sup>[239]</sup></a> is God in all that it does,
feels, and understands, and therefore can be called neither convertible
nor mutable, inasmuch as, being incessantly heated,
it possessed immutability from its union with the Word of
God. To all the saints, finally, some warmth from the Word
of God must be supposed to have passed; and in this soul the
divine fire itself must be believed to have rested, from which
some warmth may have passed to others. Lastly, the expression,
“God, thy God, anointed thee with the oil of gladness
above thy fellows,”<a id='r240'></a><a href='#f240' class='c007'><sup>[240]</sup></a> shows that that soul is anointed in one
way with the oil of gladness, <i>i.e.</i> with the word of God and
wisdom; and his fellows, <i>i.e.</i> the holy prophets and apostles,
in another. For they are said to have “run in the odour
of his ointments;”<a id='r241'></a><a href='#f241' class='c007'><sup>[241]</sup></a> and that soul was the vessel which contained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>that very ointment of whose fragrance all the worthy
prophets and apostles were made partakers. As, then, the
substance of an ointment is one thing and its odour another,
so also Christ is one thing and His fellows another. And as
the vessel itself, which contains the substance of the ointment,
can by no means admit any foul smell; whereas it is possible
that those who enjoy its odour may, if they remove a little
way from its fragrance, receive any foul odour which comes
upon them: so, in the same way, was it impossible that Christ,
being as it were the vessel itself, in which was the substance
of the ointment, should receive an odour of an opposite kind,
while they who are His “fellows” will be partakers and
receivers of His odour, in proportion to their nearness to the
vessel.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. I think, indeed, that Jeremiah the prophet, also, understanding
what was the nature of the wisdom of God in him,
which was the same also which he had assumed for the
salvation of the world, said, “The breath of our countenance
is Christ the Lord, to whom we said, that under His shadow
we shall live among the nations.”<a id='r242'></a><a href='#f242' class='c007'><sup>[242]</sup></a> And inasmuch as the
shadow of our body is inseparable from the body, and unavoidably
performs and repeats its movements and gestures, I
think that he, wishing to point out the work of Christ’s soul,
and the movements inseparably belonging to it, and which
accomplished everything according to His movements and
will, called this the shadow of Christ the Lord, under which
shadow we were to live among the nations. For in the
mystery of this assumption the nations live, who, imitating it
through faith, come to salvation. David also, when saying,
“Be mindful of my reproach, O Lord, with which they
reproached me in exchange for Thy Christ,”<a id='r243'></a><a href='#f243' class='c007'><sup>[243]</sup></a> seems to me to
indicate the same. And what else does Paul mean when he
says, “Your life is hid with Christ in God;”<a id='r244'></a><a href='#f244' class='c007'><sup>[244]</sup></a> and again in
another passage, “Do you seek a proof of Christ, who speaketh
in me?”<a id='r245'></a><a href='#f245' class='c007'><sup>[245]</sup></a> And now he says that Christ was hid in God.
The meaning of which expression, unless it be shown to be
something such as we have pointed out above as intended by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>the prophet in the words “shadow of Christ,” exceeds, perhaps,
the apprehension of the human mind. But we see also
very many other statements in holy Scripture respecting the
meaning of the word “shadow,” as that well-known one in
the Gospel according to Luke, where Gabriel says to Mary,
“The Spirit of the Lord shall come upon thee, and the power
of the Highest shall overshadow thee.”<a id='r246'></a><a href='#f246' class='c007'><sup>[246]</sup></a> And the apostle
says with reference to the law, that they who have circumcision
in the flesh, “serve for the similitude and shadow of
heavenly things.”<a id='r247'></a><a href='#f247' class='c007'><sup>[247]</sup></a> And elsewhere, “Is not our life upon the
earth a shadow?”<a id='r248'></a><a href='#f248' class='c007'><sup>[248]</sup></a> If, then, not only the law which is upon
the earth is a shadow, but also all our life which is upon the
earth is the same, and we live among the nations under the
shadow of Christ, we must see whether the truth of all these
shadows may not come to be known in that revelation, when
no longer through a glass, and darkly, but face to face, all
the saints shall deserve to behold the glory of God, and the
causes and truth of things. And the pledge of this truth
being already received through the Holy Spirit, the apostle
said, “Yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh,
yet now henceforth know we Him no more.”<a id='r249'></a><a href='#f249' class='c007'><sup>[249]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The above, meanwhile, are the thoughts which have occurred
to us, when treating of subjects of such difficulty as the incarnation
and deity of Christ. If there be any one, indeed,
who can discover something better, and who can establish
his assertions by clearer proofs from holy Scriptures, let his
opinion be received in preference to mine.</p>

<h4 id='de-principiis-b2-c7' class='c010'>CHAPTER <abbr title='seven'>VII.</abbr> <br> ON THE HOLY SPIRIT.</h4>
<p class='c005'>1. As, then, after those first discussions which, according
to the requirements of the case, we held at the beginning
regarding the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, it seemed right
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>that we should retrace our steps, and show that the same God
was the creator and founder of the world, and the Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ, <i>i.e.</i> that the God of the law and of
the prophets and of the gospel was one and the same; and
that, in the next place, it ought to be shown, with respect to
Christ, in what manner He who had formerly been demonstrated
to be the Word and Wisdom of God became man; it
remains that we now return with all possible brevity to the
subject of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is time, then, that we say a few words to the best of
our ability regarding the Holy Spirit, whom our Lord and
Saviour in the Gospel according to John has named the
Paraclete. For as it is the same God Himself, and the same
Christ, so also is it the same Holy Spirit who was in the
prophets and apostles, <i>i.e.</i> either in those who believed in
God before the advent of Christ, or in those who by means
of Christ have sought refuge in God. We have heard,
indeed, that certain heretics have dared to say that there are
two Gods and two Christs, but we have never known of the
doctrine of two Holy Spirits being preached by any one.<a id='r250'></a><a href='#f250' class='c007'><sup>[250]</sup></a>
For how could they maintain this out of Scripture, or what
distinction could they lay down between Holy Spirit and
Holy Spirit, if indeed any definition or description of Holy
Spirit can be discovered? For although we should concede
to Marcion or to Valentinus that it is possible to draw distinctions
in the question of Deity, and to describe the nature
of the good God as one, and that of the just God as another,
what will he devise, or what will he discover, to enable him
to introduce a distinction in the Holy Spirit? I consider,
then, that they are able to discover nothing which may indicate
a distinction of any kind whatever.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Now we are of opinion that every rational creature,
without any distinction, receives a share of Him in the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>way as of the Wisdom and of the Word of God. I observe,
however, that the chief advent of the Holy Spirit is declared
to men, after the ascension of Christ to heaven, rather than
before His coming into the world. For, before that, it was
upon the prophets alone, and upon a few individuals—if there
happened to be any among the people deserving of it—that
the gift of the Holy Spirit was conferred; but after the advent
of the Saviour, it is written that the prediction of the prophet
Joel was fulfilled, “In the last days it shall come to pass, and
I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh, and they shall prophesy,”<a id='r251'></a><a href='#f251' class='c007'><sup>[251]</sup></a>
which is similar to the well-known statement, “All
nations shall serve Him.”<a id='r252'></a><a href='#f252' class='c007'><sup>[252]</sup></a> By the grace, then, of the Holy
Spirit, along with numerous other results, this most glorious
consequence is clearly demonstrated, that with regard to those
things which were written in the prophets or in the law of
Moses, it was only a few persons at that time, viz. the prophets
themselves, and scarcely another individual out of
the whole nation, who were able to look beyond the mere
corporeal meaning and discover something greater, <i>i.e.</i> something
spiritual, in the law or in the prophets; but now there
are countless multitudes of believers who, although unable to
unfold methodically and clearly the results of their spiritual
understanding,<a id='r253'></a><a href='#f253' class='c007'><sup>[253]</sup></a> are nevertheless most firmly persuaded that
neither ought circumcision to be understood literally, nor the
rest of the Sabbath, nor the pouring out of the blood of an
animal, nor that answers were given by God to Moses on these
points. And this method of apprehension is undoubtedly suggested
to the minds of all by the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. And as there are many ways of apprehending Christ,
who, although He is wisdom, does not act the part or possess
the power of wisdom in all men, but only in those who give
themselves to the study of wisdom in Him; and who, although
called a physician, does not act as one towards all, but only
towards those who understand their feeble and sickly condition,
and flee to His compassion that they may obtain health;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>so also I think is it with the Holy Spirit, in whom is contained
every kind of gifts. For on some is bestowed by the Spirit
the word of wisdom, on others the word of knowledge, on
others faith; and so to each individual of those who are
capable of receiving Him, is the Spirit Himself made to be
that quality, or understood to be that which is needed by the
individual who has deserved to participate.<a id='r254'></a><a href='#f254' class='c007'><sup>[254]</sup></a> These divisions
and differences not being perceived by those who hear Him
called Paraclete in the Gospel, and not duly considering in
consequence of what work or act He is named the Paraclete,
they have compared Him to some common spirits or other,
and by this means have tried to disturb the churches of Christ,
and so excite dissensions of no small extent among brethren;
whereas the Gospel shows Him to be of such power and
majesty, that it says the apostles could not yet receive those
things which the Saviour wished to teach them until the
advent of the Holy Spirit, who, pouring Himself into their
souls, might enlighten them regarding the nature and faith
of the Trinity. But these persons, because of the ignorance of
their understandings, are not only unable themselves logically
to state the truth, but cannot even give their attention to what
is advanced by us; and entertaining unworthy ideas of His
divinity, have delivered themselves over to errors and deceits,
being depraved by a spirit of error, rather than instructed by
the teaching of the Holy Spirit, according to the declaration of
the apostle, “Following the doctrine of devils, forbidding to
marry, to the destruction and ruin of many, and to abstain
from meats, that by an ostentatious exhibition of stricter
observance they may seduce the souls of the innocent.”<a id='r255'></a><a href='#f255' class='c007'><sup>[255]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>4. We must therefore know that the Paraclete is the Holy
Spirit, who teaches truths which cannot be uttered in words,
and which are, so to speak, unutterable, and “which it is not
lawful for a man to utter,”<a id='r256'></a><a href='#f256' class='c007'><sup>[256]</sup></a> <i>i.e.</i> which cannot be indicated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>by human language. The phrase “it is not lawful” is, we
think, used by the apostle instead of “it is not possible;” as
also is the case in the passage where he says, “All things are
lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things
are lawful for me, but all things edify not.”<a id='r257'></a><a href='#f257' class='c007'><sup>[257]</sup></a> For those
things which are in our power because we may have them, he
says are lawful for us. But the Paraclete, who is called
the Holy Spirit, is so called from His work of consolation,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><i>paraclesis</i></span> being termed in Latin <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>consolatio</i></span>. For if any one
has deserved to participate in the Holy Spirit by the knowledge
of His ineffable mysteries, he undoubtedly obtains
comfort and joy of heart. For since he comes by the
teaching of the Spirit to the knowledge of the reasons of all
things which happen—how or why they occur—his soul can
in no respect be troubled, or admit any feeling of sorrow;
nor is he alarmed by anything, since, clinging to the Word of
God and His wisdom, he through the Holy Spirit calls Jesus
Lord. And since we have made mention of the Paraclete,
and have explained as we were able what sentiments ought
to be entertained regarding Him; and since our Saviour
also is called the Paraclete in the Epistle of John, when
he says, “If any of us sin, we have a Paraclete with the
Father, Jesus Christ the righteous, and He is the propitiation
for our sins;”<a id='r258'></a><a href='#f258' class='c007'><sup>[258]</sup></a> let us consider whether this term Paraclete
should happen to have one meaning when applied to the
Saviour, and another when applied to the Holy Spirit. Now
Paraclete, when spoken of the Saviour, seems to mean intercessor.
For in Greek, Paraclete has both significations—that
of intercessor and comforter. On account, then, of
the phrase which follows, when he says, “And He is the
propitiation for our sins,” the name Paraclete seems to be
understood in the case of our Saviour as meaning intercessor;
for He is said to intercede with the Father because of our
sins. In the case of the Holy Spirit, the Paraclete must be
understood in the sense of comforter, inasmuch as He bestows
consolation upon the souls to whom He openly reveals the
apprehension of spiritual knowledge.</p>

  <h4 id='de-principiis-b2-c8' class='c010'>CHAPTER <abbr title='eight'>VIII.</abbr> <br> ON THE SOUL (ANIMA).</h4>
</div>
<p class='c005'>1. The order of our arrangement now requires us, after
the discussion of the preceding subjects, to institute a general
inquiry regarding the soul;<a id='r259'></a><a href='#f259' class='c007'><sup>[259]</sup></a> and, beginning with points of
inferior importance, to ascend to those that are of greater.
Now, that there are souls<a id='r260'></a><a href='#f260' class='c007'><sup>[260]</sup></a> in all living things, even in those
which live in the waters, is, I suppose, doubted by no one.
For the general opinion of all men maintains this; and confirmation
from the authority of holy Scripture is added, when
it is said that “God made great whales, and every living
creature<a id='r261'></a><a href='#f261' class='c007'><sup>[261]</sup></a> that moveth which the waters brought forth after
their kind.”<a id='r262'></a><a href='#f262' class='c007'><sup>[262]</sup></a> It is confirmed also from the common intelligence
of reason, by those who lay down in certain words a
definition of soul. For soul is defined as follows: a substance
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φανταστικὴ</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὁρμητικὴ</span>, which may be rendered into Latin,
although not so appropriately, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sensibilis et mobilis</i></span>.<a id='r263'></a><a href='#f263' class='c007'><sup>[263]</sup></a> This
certainly may be said appropriately of all living beings, even
of those which abide in the waters; and of winged creatures
too, this same definition of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>anima</i></span> may be shown to hold good.
Scripture also has added its authority to a second opinion,
when it says, “Ye shall not eat the blood, because the life<a id='r264'></a><a href='#f264' class='c007'><sup>[264]</sup></a>
of all flesh is its blood; and ye shall not eat the life with the
flesh;”<a id='r265'></a><a href='#f265' class='c007'><sup>[265]</sup></a> in which it intimates most clearly that the blood of
every animal is its life. And if any one now were to ask
how it can be said with respect to bees, wasps, and ants, and
those other things which are in the waters, oysters and
cockles, and all others which are without blood, and are most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>clearly shown to be living things, that the “life of all flesh
is the blood,” we must answer, that in living things of that
sort the force which is exerted in other animals by the power
of red blood is exerted in them by that liquid which is within
them, although it be of a different colour; for colour is a
thing of no importance, provided the substance be endowed
with life.<a id='r266'></a><a href='#f266' class='c007'><sup>[266]</sup></a> That beasts of burden or cattle of smaller size
are endowed with souls,<a id='r267'></a><a href='#f267' class='c007'><sup>[267]</sup></a> there is, by general assent, no doubt
whatever. The opinion of holy Scripture, however, is manifest,
when God says, “Let the earth bring forth the living
creature after its kind, four-footed beasts, and creeping
things, and beasts of the earth after their kind.”<a id='r268'></a><a href='#f268' class='c007'><sup>[268]</sup></a> And now
with respect to man, although no one entertains any doubt,
or needs to inquire, yet holy Scripture declares that “God
breathed into his countenance the breath of life, and man became
a living soul.”<a id='r269'></a><a href='#f269' class='c007'><sup>[269]</sup></a> It remains that we inquire respecting
the angelic order whether they also have souls, or are souls;
and also respecting the other divine and celestial powers, as
well as those of an opposite kind. We nowhere, indeed, find
any authority in holy Scripture for asserting that either the
angels, or any other divine spirits that are ministers of God,
either possess souls or are called souls, and yet they are felt
by very many persons to be endowed with life. But with
regard to God, we find it written as follows: “And I will
put my soul upon that soul which has eaten blood, and I will
root him out from among his people;”<a id='r270'></a><a href='#f270' class='c007'><sup>[270]</sup></a> and also in another
passage, “Your new moons, and sabbaths, and great days, I
will not accept; your fasts, and holidays, and festal days,
my soul hateth.”<a id='r271'></a><a href='#f271' class='c007'><sup>[271]</sup></a> And in the twenty-second Psalm, regarding
Christ—for it is certain, as the Gospel bears witness,
that this Psalm is spoken of Him—the following words
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>occur: “O Lord, be not far from helping me; look to my
defence: O God, deliver my soul from the sword, and my
beloved one from the hand of the dog;”<a id='r272'></a><a href='#f272' class='c007'><sup>[272]</sup></a> although there are
also many other testimonies respecting the soul of Christ
when He tabernacled in the flesh.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. But the nature of the incarnation will render unnecessary
any inquiry into the soul of Christ. For as He truly possessed
flesh, so also He truly possessed a soul. It is difficult
indeed both to feel and to state how that which is called in
Scripture the soul of God is to be understood; for we
acknowledge that nature to be simple, and without any intermixture
or addition. In whatever way, however, it is to be
understood, it seems, meanwhile, to be named the soul of
God; whereas regarding Christ there is no doubt. And
therefore there seems to me no absurdity in either understanding
or asserting some such thing regarding the holy
angels and the other heavenly powers, since that definition of
soul appears applicable also to them. For who can rationally
deny that they are “sensible and moveable?” But if that
definition appear to be correct, according to which a soul is
said to be a substance rationally “sensible and moveable,”
the same definition would seem also to apply to angels. For
what else is in them than rational feeling and motion? Now
those beings who are comprehended under the same definition
have undoubtedly the same substance. Paul indeed intimates
that there is a kind of animal-man<a id='r273'></a><a href='#f273' class='c007'><sup>[273]</sup></a> who, he says, cannot
receive the things of the Spirit of God, but declares that
the doctrine of the Holy Spirit seems to him foolish, and that
he cannot understand what is to be spiritually discerned. In
another passage he says it is sown an animal body, and arises
a spiritual body, pointing out that in the resurrection of the
just there will be nothing of an animal nature. And therefore
we inquire whether there happen to be any substance
which, in respect of its being <i>anima</i>, is imperfect. But
whether it be imperfect because it falls away from perfection,
or because it was so created by God, will form the subject of
inquiry when each individual topic shall begin to be discussed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>in order. For if the animal man receive not the things of
the Spirit of God, and because he is animal, is unable to
admit the understanding of a better, <i>i.e.</i> of a divine nature,
it is for this reason perhaps that Paul, wishing to teach us
more plainly what that is by means of which we are able to
comprehend those things which are of the Spirit, <i>i.e.</i> spiritual
things, conjoins and associates with the Holy Spirit an understanding<a id='r274'></a><a href='#f274' class='c007'><sup>[274]</sup></a>
rather than a soul.<a id='r275'></a><a href='#f275' class='c007'><sup>[275]</sup></a> For this, I think, he indicates
when he says, “I will pray with the spirit, I will pray with
the understanding also; I will sing with the spirit, I will sing
with the understanding also.”<a id='r276'></a><a href='#f276' class='c007'><sup>[276]</sup></a> And he does not say that
“I will pray with the soul,” but with the spirit and the
understanding. Nor does he say, “I will sing with the soul,”
but with the spirit and the understanding.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. But perhaps this question is asked, If it be the understanding
which prays and sings with the spirit, and if it be the
same which receives both perfection and salvation, how is it
that Peter says, “Receiving the end of your faith, even the
salvation of your souls?”<a id='r277'></a><a href='#f277' class='c007'><sup>[277]</sup></a> If the soul neither prays nor
sings with the spirit, how shall it hope for salvation? or
when it attains to blessedness, shall it be no longer called a
soul?<a id='r278'></a><a href='#f278' class='c007'><sup>[278]</sup></a> Let us see if perhaps an answer may be given in
this way, that as the Saviour came to save what was lost,
that which formerly was said to be lost is not lost when it
is saved; so also, perhaps, this which is saved is called a
soul, and when it has been placed in a state of salvation will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>receive a name from the Word that denotes its more perfect
condition. But it appears to some that this also may be
added, that as the thing which was lost undoubtedly existed
before it was lost, at which time it was something else than
destroyed, so also will be the case when it is no longer in a
ruined condition. In like manner also, the soul which is said
to have perished will appear to have been something at one
time, when as yet it had not perished, and on that account
would be termed soul, and being again freed from destruction,
it may become a second time what it was before it perished,
and be called a soul. But from the very signification of the
name soul which the Greek word conveys, it has appeared to
a few curious inquirers that a meaning of no small importance
may be suggested. For in sacred language God is
called a fire, as when Scripture says, “Our God is a consuming
fire.”<a id='r279'></a><a href='#f279' class='c007'><sup>[279]</sup></a> Respecting the substance of the angels also
it speaks as follows: “Who maketh His angels spirits, and
His ministers a burning fire;”<a id='r280'></a><a href='#f280' class='c007'><sup>[280]</sup></a> and in another place, “The
angel of the Lord appeared in a flame of fire in the bush.”<a id='r281'></a><a href='#f281' class='c007'><sup>[281]</sup></a>
We have, moreover, received a commandment to be “fervent
in spirit;”<a id='r282'></a><a href='#f282' class='c007'><sup>[282]</sup></a> by which expression undoubtedly the Word of
God is shown to be hot and fiery. The prophet Jeremiah
also hears from Him, who gave him his answers, “Behold, I
have given my words into thy mouth a fire.”<a id='r283'></a><a href='#f283' class='c007'><sup>[283]</sup></a> As God,
then, is a fire, and the angels a flame of fire, and all the
saints are fervent in spirit, so, on the contrary, those who
have fallen away from the love of God are undoubtedly said
to have cooled in their affection for Him, and to have become
cold. For the Lord also says, that, “because iniquity has
abounded, the love of many will grow cold.”<a id='r284'></a><a href='#f284' class='c007'><sup>[284]</sup></a> Nay, all
things, whatever they are, which in holy Scripture are compared
with the hostile power, the devil is said to be perpetually
finding cold; and what is found to be colder than he? In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>the sea also the dragon is said to reign. For the prophet<a id='r285'></a><a href='#f285' class='c007'><sup>[285]</sup></a>
intimates that the serpent and dragon, which certainly is
referred to one of the wicked spirits, is also in the sea. And
elsewhere the prophet says, “I will draw out my holy sword
upon the dragon the flying serpent, upon the dragon the
crooked serpent, and will slay him.”<a id='r286'></a><a href='#f286' class='c007'><sup>[286]</sup></a> And again he says:
“Even though they hide from my eyes, and descend into the
depths of the sea, there will I command the serpent, and it
shall bite them.”<a id='r287'></a><a href='#f287' class='c007'><sup>[287]</sup></a> In the book of Job also, he is said to be
the king of all things in the waters.<a id='r288'></a><a href='#f288' class='c007'><sup>[288]</sup></a> The prophet<a id='r289'></a><a href='#f289' class='c007'><sup>[289]</sup></a> threatens
that evils will be kindled by the north wind upon all who
inhabit the earth. Now the north wind is described in holy
Scripture as cold, according to the statement in the book of
Wisdom, “That cold north wind;”<a id='r290'></a><a href='#f290' class='c007'><sup>[290]</sup></a> which same thing also
must undoubtedly be understood of the devil. If, then, those
things which are holy are named fire, and light, and fervent,
while those which are of an opposite nature are said to be
cold; and if the love of many is said to wax cold; we have
to inquire whether perhaps the name soul, which in Greek
is termed <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ψυχή</span>, be so termed from growing cold<a id='r291'></a><a href='#f291' class='c007'><sup>[291]</sup></a> out of a
better and more divine condition, and be thence derived, because
it seems to have cooled from that natural and divine
warmth, and therefore has been placed in its present position,
and called by its present name. Finally, see if you can
easily find a place in holy Scripture where the soul is properly
mentioned in terms of praise: it frequently occurs,
on the contrary, accompanied with expressions of censure, as
in the passage, “An evil soul ruins him who possesses it;”<a id='r292'></a><a href='#f292' class='c007'><sup>[292]</sup></a>
and, “The soul which sinneth, it shall die.”<a id='r293'></a><a href='#f293' class='c007'><sup>[293]</sup></a> For after it has
been said, “All souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so
also the soul of the son is mine,”<a id='r294'></a><a href='#f294' class='c007'><sup>[294]</sup></a> it seemed to follow that
He would say, “The soul that doeth righteousness, it shall
be saved,” and “The soul which sinneth, it shall die.” But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>now we see that He has associated with the soul what is censurable,
and has been silent as to that which was deserving
of praise. We have therefore to see if, perchance, as we
have said is declared by the name itself, it was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ψυχή</span>,
<i>i.e.</i> <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>anima</i></span>, because it has waxed cold from the fervour of just
things,<a id='r295'></a><a href='#f295' class='c007'><sup>[295]</sup></a> and from participation in the divine fire, and yet has
not lost the power of restoring itself to that condition of fervour
in which it was at the beginning. Whence the prophet
also appears to point out some such state of things by the
words, “Return, O my soul, unto thy rest.”<a id='r296'></a><a href='#f296' class='c007'><sup>[296]</sup></a> From all
which this appears to be made out, that the understanding,
falling away from its status and dignity, was made or named
soul; and that, if repaired and corrected, it returns to the
condition of the understanding.<a id='r297'></a><a href='#f297' class='c007'><sup>[297]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>4. Now, if this be the case, it seems to me that this very
decay and falling away of the understanding is not the same
in all, but that this conversion into a soul is carried to a greater
or less degree in different instances, and that certain understandings
retain something even of their former vigour, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>others again either nothing or a very small amount. Whence
some are found from the very commencement of their lives
to be of more active intellect, others again of a slower habit
of mind, and some are born wholly obtuse, and altogether
incapable of instruction. Our statement, however, that the
understanding is converted into a soul, or whatever else seems
to have such a meaning, the reader must carefully consider
and settle for himself, as these views are not to be regarded
as advanced by us in a dogmatic manner, but simply as
opinions, treated in the style of investigation and discussion.
Let the reader take this also into consideration, that it is
observed with regard to the soul of the Saviour, that of those
things which are written in the Gospel, some are ascribed to
it under the name of soul, and others under that of spirit.
For when it wishes to indicate any suffering or perturbation
affecting Him, it indicates it under the name of soul; as when
it says, “Now is my soul troubled;”<a id='r298'></a><a href='#f298' class='c007'><sup>[298]</sup></a> and, “My soul is sorrowful,
even unto death;”<a id='r299'></a><a href='#f299' class='c007'><sup>[299]</sup></a> and, “No man taketh my soul<a id='r300'></a><a href='#f300' class='c007'><sup>[300]</sup></a> from
me, but I lay it down of myself.”<a id='r301'></a><a href='#f301' class='c007'><sup>[301]</sup></a> Into the hands of His
Father He commends not His soul, but His spirit; and when
He says that the flesh is weak, He does not say that the soul
is willing, but the spirit: whence it appears that the soul
is something intermediate between the weak flesh and the
willing spirit.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. But perhaps some one may meet us with one of those
objections which we have ourselves warned you of in our
statements, and say, “How then is there said to be also a soul
of God?” To which we answer as follows: That as with
respect to everything corporeal which is spoken of God, such
as fingers, or hands, or arms, or eyes, or feet, or mouth, we
say that these are not to be understood as human members,
but that certain of his powers are indicated by these names
of members of the body; so also we are to suppose that it is
something else which is pointed out by this title—soul of God.
And if it is allowable for us to venture to say anything more
on such a subject, the soul of God may perhaps be understood
to mean the only-begotten Son of God. For as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>soul, when implanted in the body, moves all things in it, and
exerts its force over everything on which it operates; so also
the only-begotten Son of God, who is His Word and Wisdom,
stretches and extends to every power of God, being implanted
in it; and perhaps to indicate this mystery is God either called
or described in Scripture as a body. We must, indeed, take
into consideration whether it is not perhaps on this account
that the soul of God may be understood to mean His only-begotten
Son, because He Himself came into this world of
affliction, and descended into this valley of tears, and into this
place of our humiliation; as He says in the Psalm, “Because
Thou hast humiliated us in the place of affliction.”<a id='r302'></a><a href='#f302' class='c007'><sup>[302]</sup></a> Finally,
I am aware that certain critics, in explaining the words used
in the Gospel by the Saviour, “My soul is sorrowful, even
unto death,” have interpreted them of the apostles, whom He
termed His soul, as being better than the rest of His body.
For as the multitude of believers is called His body, they say
that the apostles, as being better than the rest of the body,
ought to be understood to mean His soul.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have brought forward as we best could these points
regarding the rational soul, as topics of discussion for our
readers, rather than as dogmatic and well-defined propositions.
And with respect to the souls of animals and other
dumb creatures, let that suffice which we have stated above
in general terms.</p>

<h4 id='de-principiis-b2-c9' class='c010'>CHAPTER <abbr title='nine'>IX.</abbr> <br> ON THE WORLD AND THE MOVEMENTS OF RATIONAL CREATURES, WHETHER GOOD OR BAD; AND ON THE CAUSES OF THEM.</h4>
<p class='c005'>1. But let us now return to the order of our proposed discussion,
and behold the commencement of creation, so far as
the understanding can behold the beginning of the creation
of God. In that commencement,<a id='r303'></a><a href='#f303' class='c007'><sup>[303]</sup></a> then, we are to suppose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>that God created so great a number of rational or intellectual
creatures (or by whatever name they are to be called), which
we have formerly termed understandings, as He foresaw would
be sufficient. It is certain that He made them according to
some definite number, predetermined by Himself: for it is
not to be imagined, as some would have it, that creatures have
not a limit, because where there is no limit there can neither
be any comprehension nor any limitation. Now if this were
the case, then certainly created things could neither be restrained
nor administered by God. For, naturally, whatever
is infinite will also be incomprehensible. Moreover, as
Scripture says, “God has arranged all things in number and
measure;”<a id='r304'></a><a href='#f304' class='c007'><sup>[304]</sup></a> and therefore number will be correctly applied to
rational creatures or understandings, that they may be so
numerous as to admit of being arranged, governed, and controlled
by God. But measure will be appropriately applied
to a material body; and this measure, we are to believe, was
created by God such as He knew would be sufficient for the
adorning of the world. These, then, are the things which
we are to believe were created by God in the beginning, <i>i.e.</i>
before all things. And this, we think, is indicated even in
that beginning which Moses has introduced in terms somewhat
ambiguous, when he says, “In the beginning God made
the heaven and the earth.”<a id='r305'></a><a href='#f305' class='c007'><sup>[305]</sup></a> For it is certain that the firmament
is not spoken of, nor the dry land, but that heaven
and earth from which this present heaven and earth which
we now see afterwards borrowed their names.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>2. But since those rational natures, which we have said
above were made in the beginning, were created when they
did not previously exist, in consequence of this very fact of
their non-existence and commencement of being, are they
necessarily changeable and mutable; since whatever power
was in their substance was not in it by nature, but was the
result of the goodness of their Maker. What they are,
therefore, is neither their own nor endures for ever, but is
bestowed by God. For it did not always exist; and everything
which is a gift may also be taken away, and disappear.
And a reason for removal will consist in the movements of
souls not being conducted according to right and propriety.
For the Creator gave, as an indulgence to the understandings
created by Him, the power of free and voluntary action, by
which the good that was in them might become their own,
being preserved by the exertion of their own will; but slothfulness,
and a dislike of labour in preserving what is good,
and an aversion to and a neglect of better things, furnished
the beginning of a departure from goodness. But to depart
from good is nothing else than to be made bad. For it is
certain that to want goodness is to be wicked. Whence it
happens that, in proportion as one falls away from goodness,
in the same proportion does he become involved in wickedness.
In which condition, according to its actions, each
understanding, neglecting goodness either to a greater or
more limited extent, was dragged into the opposite of good,
which undoubtedly is evil. From which it appears that the
Creator of all things admitted certain seeds and causes of
variety and diversity, that He might create variety and diversity
in proportion to the diversity of understandings, <i>i.e.</i>
of rational creatures, which diversity they must be supposed
to have conceived from that cause which we have mentioned
above. And what we mean by variety and diversity is what
we now wish to explain.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. Now we term world everything which is above the
heavens, or in the heavens, or upon the earth, or in those
places which are called the lower regions, or all places whatever
that anywhere exist, together with their inhabitants.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>This whole, then, is called world. In which world certain
beings are said to be super-celestial, <i>i.e.</i> placed in happier
abodes, and clothed with heavenly and resplendent bodies;
and among these many distinctions are shown to exist, the
apostle, <i>e.g.</i>, saying, “That one is the glory of the sun, another
the glory of the moon, another the glory of the stars;
for one star differeth from another star in glory.”<a id='r306'></a><a href='#f306' class='c007'><sup>[306]</sup></a> Certain
beings are called earthly, and among them, <i>i.e.</i> among men,
there is no small difference; for some of them are Barbarians,
others Greeks; and of the Barbarians some are savage and
fierce, and others of a milder disposition. And certain of
them live under laws that have been thoroughly approved;
others, again, under laws of a more common or severe kind;<a id='r307'></a><a href='#f307' class='c007'><sup>[307]</sup></a>
while some, again, possess customs of an inhuman and savage
character, rather than laws. And certain of them, from the
hour of their birth, are reduced to humiliation and subjection,
and brought up as slaves, being placed under the
dominion either of masters, or princes, or tyrants. Others,
again, are brought up in a manner more consonant with freedom
and reason: some with sound bodies, some with bodies
diseased from their early years; some defective in vision,
others in hearing and speech; some born in that condition,
others deprived of the use of their senses immediately after
birth, or at least undergoing such misfortune on reaching
manhood. And why should I repeat and enumerate all the
horrors of human misery, from which some have been free,
and in which others have been involved, when each one can
weigh and consider them for himself? There are also certain
invisible powers to which earthly things have been entrusted
for administration; and amongst them no small difference
must be believed to exist, as is also found to be the case
among men. The Apostle Paul indeed intimates that there
are certain lower powers,<a id='r308'></a><a href='#f308' class='c007'><sup>[308]</sup></a> and that among them, in like
manner, must undoubtedly be sought a ground of diversity.
Regarding dumb animals, and birds, and those creatures
which live in the waters, it seems superfluous to inquire;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>since it is certain that these ought to be regarded not as of
primary, but of subordinate rank.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. Seeing, then, that all things which have been created are
said to have been made through Christ, and in Christ, as the
Apostle Paul most clearly indicates, when he says, “For in
Him and by Him were all things created, whether things in
heaven or things on earth, visible and invisible, whether they
be thrones, or powers, or principalities, or dominions; all
things were created by Him, and in Him;”<a id='r309'></a><a href='#f309' class='c007'><sup>[309]</sup></a> and as in his
Gospel John indicates the same thing, saying, “In the beginning
was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the
Word was God: the same was in the beginning with God:
all things were made by Him; and without Him was not anything
made;”<a id='r310'></a><a href='#f310' class='c007'><sup>[310]</sup></a> and as in the Psalm also it is written, “In
wisdom hast Thou made them all;”<a id='r311'></a><a href='#f311' class='c007'><sup>[311]</sup></a>—seeing, then, Christ
is, as it were, the Word and Wisdom, and so also the Righteousness,
it will undoubtedly follow that those things which
were created in the Word and Wisdom are said to be created
also in that righteousness which is Christ; that in created
things there may appear to be nothing unrighteous or accidental,
but that all things may be shown to be in conformity
with the law of equity and righteousness. How, then, so
great a variety of things, and so great a diversity, can be understood
to be altogether just and righteous, I am sure no human
power or language can explain, unless as prostrate suppliants
we pray to the Word, and Wisdom, and Righteousness Himself,
who is the only-begotten Son of God, and who, pouring
Himself by His graces into our senses, may deign to illuminate
what is dark, to lay open what is concealed, and to reveal
what is secret; if, indeed, we should be found either to seek,
or ask, or knock so worthily as to deserve to receive when
we ask, or to find when we seek, or to have it opened to us
when we knock. Not relying, then, on our own powers, but
on the help of that Wisdom which made all things, and of
that Righteousness which we believe to be in all His creatures,
although we are in the meantime unable to declare it,
yet, trusting in His mercy, we shall endeavour to examine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>and inquire how that great variety and diversity in the world
may appear to be consistent with all righteousness and reason.
I mean, of course, merely reason in general; for it would be
a mark of ignorance either to seek, or of folly to give, a
special reason for each individual case.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. Now, when we say that this world was established in
the variety in which we have above explained that it was
created by God, and when we say that this God is good, and
righteous, and most just, there are numerous individuals,
especially those who, coming from the school of Marcion,
and Valentinus, and Basilides, have heard that there are souls
of different natures, who object to us, that it cannot consist
with the justice of God in creating the world to assign to
some of His creatures an abode in the heavens, and not only
to give such a better habitation, but also to grant them a
higher and more honourable position; to favour others with
the grant of principalities; to bestow powers upon some,
dominions on others; to confer upon some the most honourable
seats in the celestial tribunals; to enable some to shine
with more resplendent glory, and to glitter with a starry
splendour; to give to some the glory of the sun, to others
the glory of the moon, to others the glory of the stars; to
cause one star to differ from another star in glory. And, to
speak once for all, and briefly, if the Creator God wants
neither the will to undertake nor the power to complete a
good and perfect work, what reason can there be that, in the
creation of rational natures, <i>i.e.</i> of beings of whose existence
He Himself is the cause, He should make some of higher
rank, and others of second, or third, or of many lower and
inferior degrees? In the next place, they object to us, with
regard to terrestrial beings, that a happier lot by birth is the
case with some rather than with others; as one man, <i>e.g.</i>, is
begotten of Abraham, and born of the promise; another, too,
of Isaac and Rebekah, and who, while still in the womb,
supplants his brother, and is said to be loved by God before
he is born. Nay, this very circumstance,—especially that
one man is born among the Hebrews, with whom he finds
instruction in the divine law; another among the Greeks,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>themselves also wise, and men of no small learning; and
then another amongst the Ethiopians, who are accustomed
to feed on human flesh; or amongst the Scythians, with
whom parricide is an act sanctioned by law; or amongst
the people of Taurus, where strangers are offered in sacrifice,—is
a ground of strong objection. Their argument accordingly
is this: If there be this great diversity of circumstances,
and this diverse and varying condition by birth, in
which the faculty of free-will has no scope (for no one chooses
for himself either where, or with whom, or in what condition
he is born); if, then, this is not caused by the difference
in the nature of souls, <i>i.e.</i> that a soul of an evil nature is
destined for a wicked nation, and a good soul for a righteous
nation, what other conclusion remains than that these things
must be supposed to be regulated by accident and chance?
And if that be admitted, then it will be no longer believed
that the world was made by God, or administered by His
providence; and as a consequence, a judgment of God upon
the deeds of each individual will appear a thing not to be
looked for. In which matter, indeed, what is clearly the truth
of things is the privilege of Him alone to know who searches
all things, even the deep things of God.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. We, however, although but men, not to nourish the
insolence of the heretics by our silence, will return to their
objections such answers as occur to us, so far as our abilities
enable us. We have frequently shown, by those declarations
which we were able to produce from the holy Scriptures,
that God, the Creator of all things, is good, and just, and
all-powerful. When He in the beginning created those
beings which He desired to create, <i>i.e.</i> rational natures, He
had no other reason for creating them than on account of
Himself, <i>i.e.</i> His own goodness. As He Himself, then, was
the cause of the existence of those things which were to be
created, in whom there was neither any variation nor change,
nor want of power, He created all whom He made equal and
alike, because there was in Himself no reason for producing
variety and diversity. But since those rational creatures
themselves, as we have frequently shown, and will yet show
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>in the proper place, were endowed with the power of free-will,
this freedom of will incited each one either to progress
by imitation of God, or reduced him to failure through
negligence. And this, as we have already stated, is the
cause of the diversity among rational creatures, deriving
its origin not from the will or judgment of the Creator, but
from the freedom of the individual will. Now God, who
deemed it just to arrange His creatures according to their
merit, brought down these different understandings into the
harmony of one world, that He might adorn, as it were, one
dwelling, in which there ought to be not only vessels of gold
and silver, but also of wood and clay (and some indeed to
honour, and others to dishonour), with those different vessels,
or souls, or understandings. And these are the causes, in
my opinion, why that world presents the aspect of diversity,
while Divine Providence continues to regulate each individual
according to the variety of his movements, or of his feelings
and purpose. On which account the Creator will neither
appear to be unjust in distributing (for the causes already
mentioned) to every one according to his merits; nor will
the happiness or unhappiness of each one’s birth, or whatever
be the condition that falls to his lot, be deemed accidental;
nor will different creators, or souls of different natures, be
believed to exist.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. But even holy Scripture does not appear to me to be
altogether silent on the nature of this secret, as when the
Apostle Paul, in discussing the case of Jacob and Esau, says:
“For the children being not yet born, neither having done
any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election
might stand, not of works, but of Him who calleth, it
was said, The elder shall serve the younger, as it is written,
Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.”<a id='r312'></a><a href='#f312' class='c007'><sup>[312]</sup></a> And after
that, he answers himself, and says, “What shall we say
then? Is there unrighteousness with God?” And that he
might furnish us with an opportunity of inquiring into these
matters, and of ascertaining how these things do not happen
without a reason, he answers himself, and says, “God forbid.”<a id='r313'></a><a href='#f313' class='c007'><sup>[313]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>For the same question, as it seems to me, which is
raised concerning Jacob and Esau, may be raised regarding
all celestial and terrestrial creatures, and even those of the
lower world as well. And in like manner it seems to me,
that as he there says, “The children being not yet born,
neither having done any good or evil,” so it might also be
said of all other things, “When they were not yet” created,
“neither had yet done any good or evil, that the decree
of God according to election may stand,” that (as certain
think) some things on the one hand were created heavenly,
some on the other earthly, and others, again, beneath the
earth, “not of works” (as they think), “but of Him who
calleth,” what shall we say then, if these things are so? “Is
there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.” As, therefore,
when the Scriptures are carefully examined regarding Jacob
and Esau, it is not found to be unrighteousness with God
that it should be said, before they were born, or had done
anything in this life, “the elder shall serve the younger;”
and as it is found not to be unrighteousness that even in the
womb Jacob supplanted his brother, if we feel that he was
worthily beloved by God, according to the deserts of his previous
life, so as to deserve to be preferred before his brother;
so also is it with regard to heavenly creatures, if we notice
that diversity was not the original condition of the creature, but
that, owing to causes that have previously existed, a different
office is prepared by the Creator for each one in proportion
to the degree of his merit, on this ground, indeed, that each
one, in respect of having been created by God an understanding,
or a rational spirit, has, according to the movements
of his mind and the feelings of his soul, gained for
himself a greater or less amount of merit, and has become
either an object of love to God, or else one of dislike to
Him; while, nevertheless, some of those who are possessed
of greater merit are ordained to suffer with others for the
adorning of the state of the world, and for the discharge of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>duty to creatures of a lower grade, in order that by this
means they themselves may be participators in the endurance
of the Creator, according to the words of the apostle: “For
the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but
by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope.”<a id='r314'></a><a href='#f314' class='c007'><sup>[314]</sup></a>
Keeping in view, then, the sentiment expressed by the
apostle, when, speaking of the birth of Esau and Jacob, he
says, “Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid,”
I think it right that this same sentiment should be carefully
applied to the case of all other creatures, because, as we
formerly remarked, the righteousness of the Creator ought
to appear in everything. And this, it appears to me, will be
seen more clearly at last, if each one, whether of celestial or
terrestrial or infernal beings, be said to have the causes of
his diversity in himself, and antecedent to his bodily birth.
For all things were created by the Word of God, and by His
Wisdom, and were set in order by His Justice. And by the
grace of His compassion He provides for all men, and encourages
all to the use of whatever remedies may lead to
their cure, and incites them to salvation.</p>

<p class='c006'>8. As, then, there is no doubt that at the day of judgment
the good will be separated from the bad, and the just from
the unjust, and all by the sentence of God will be distributed
according to their deserts throughout those places of
which they are worthy, so I am of opinion some such
state of things was formerly the case, as, God willing, we
shall show in what follows. For God must be believed to
do and order all things and at all times according to His
judgment. For the words which the apostle uses when he
says, “In a great house there are not only vessels of gold
and silver, but also of wood and of earth, and some to
honour and some to dishonour;”<a id='r315'></a><a href='#f315' class='c007'><sup>[315]</sup></a> and those which he adds,
saying, “If a man purge himself, he will be a vessel unto
honour, sanctified and meet for the Master’s use, unto every
good work,”<a id='r316'></a><a href='#f316' class='c007'><sup>[316]</sup></a> undoubtedly point out this, that he who shall
purge himself when he is in this life, will be prepared for
every good work in that which is to come; while he who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>does not purge himself will be, according to the amount of
his impurity, a vessel unto dishonour, <i>i.e.</i> unworthy. It is
therefore possible to understand that there have been also
formerly rational vessels, whether purged or not, <i>i.e.</i> which
either purged themselves or did not do so, and that consequently
every vessel, according to the measure of its purity
or impurity, received a place, or region, or condition by birth,
or an office to discharge, in this world. All of which, down
to the humblest, God providing for and distinguishing by the
power of His wisdom, arranges all things by His controlling
judgment, according to a most impartial retribution, so far
as each one ought to be assisted or cared for in conformity
with his deserts. In which certainly every principle of equity
is shown, while the inequality of circumstances preserves the
justice of a retribution according to merit. But the grounds
of the merits in each individual case are only recognised
truly and clearly by God Himself, along with His only-begotten
Word, and His Wisdom, and the Holy Spirit.</p>

<h4 id='de-principiis-b2-c10' class='c010'>CHAPTER <abbr title='ten'>X.</abbr> <br> ON THE RESURRECTION, AND THE JUDGMENT, THE FIRE OF HELL, AND PUNISHMENTS.</h4>
<p class='c005'>1. But since the discourse has reminded us of the subjects
of a future judgment and of retribution, and of the
punishments of sinners, according to the threatenings of
holy Scripture and the contents of the church’s teaching—viz.,
that when the time of judgment comes, everlasting fire,
and outer darkness, and a prison, and a furnace, and other
punishments of like nature, have been prepared for sinners—let
us see what our opinions on these points ought to be.
But that these subjects may be arrived at in proper order,
it seems to me that we ought first to consider the nature
of the resurrection, that we may know what that [body] is
which shall come either to punishment, or to rest, or to happiness;
which question in other treatises which we have composed
regarding the resurrection we have discussed at greater
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>length, and have shown what our opinions were regarding it.
But now, also, for the sake of logical order in our treatise, there
will be no absurdity in re-stating a few points from such
works, especially since some take offence at the creed of the
church, as if our belief in the resurrection were foolish, and
altogether devoid of sense; and these are principally heretics,
who, I think, are to be answered in the following manner.
If they also admit that there is a resurrection of the dead,
let them answer us this, What is that which died? Was it
not a body? It is of the body, then, that there will be a resurrection.
Let them next tell us if they think that we are to
make use of bodies or not. I think that when the Apostle
Paul says, that “it is sown a natural body, it will arise a
spiritual body,”<a id='r317'></a><a href='#f317' class='c007'><sup>[317]</sup></a> they cannot deny that it is a body which
arises, or that in the resurrection we are to make use of
bodies. What then? If it is certain that we are to make
use of bodies, and if the bodies which have fallen are declared
to rise again (for only that which before has fallen
can be properly said to rise again), it can be a matter of
doubt to no one that they rise again, in order that we may
be clothed with them a second time at the resurrection. The
one thing is closely connected with the other. For if bodies
rise again, they undoubtedly rise to be coverings for us; and
if it is necessary for us to be invested with bodies, as it is
certainly necessary, we ought to be invested with no other
than our own. But if it is true that these rise again, and
that they arise “spiritual” bodies, there can be no doubt that
they are said to rise from the dead, after casting away corruption
and laying aside mortality; otherwise it will appear
vain and superfluous for any one to arise from the dead in
order to die a second time. And this, finally, may be more
distinctly comprehended thus, if one carefully consider what
are the qualities of an animal body, which, when sown into
the earth, recovers the qualities of a spiritual body. For it
is out of the animal body that the very power and grace of
the resurrection educe the spiritual body, when it transmutes
it from a condition of indignity to one of glory.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>2. Since the heretics, however, think themselves persons of
great learning and wisdom, we shall ask them if every body
has a form of some kind, <i>i.e.</i> is fashioned according to some
shape. And if they shall say that a body is that which is
fashioned according to no shape, they will show themselves to
be the most ignorant and foolish of mankind. For no one
will deny this, save him who is altogether without any learning.
But if, as a matter of course, they say that every body is
certainly fashioned according to some definite shape, we shall
ask them if they can point out and describe to us the shape
of a spiritual body; a thing which they can by no means do.
We shall ask them, moreover, about the differences of those
who rise again. How will they show that statement to be
true, that there is “one flesh of birds, another of fishes;
bodies celestial, and bodies terrestrial; that the glory of the
celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial another; that
one is the glory of the sun, another the glory of the moon,
another the glory of the stars; that one star differeth from
another star in glory, and that so is the resurrection of the
dead?”<a id='r318'></a><a href='#f318' class='c007'><sup>[318]</sup></a> According to that gradation, then, which exists
among heavenly bodies, let them show to us the differences
in the glory of those who rise again; and if they have
endeavoured by any means to devise a principle that may be
in accordance with the differences in heavenly bodies, we
shall ask them to assign the differences in the resurrection by
a comparison of earthly bodies. Our understanding of the
passage indeed is, that the apostle, wishing to describe the
great difference among those who rise again in glory, <i>i.e.</i> of
the saints, borrowed a comparison from the heavenly bodies,
saying, “One is the glory of the sun, another the glory of
the moon, another the glory of the stars.” And wishing
again to teach us the differences among those who shall come
to the resurrection, without having purged themselves in this
life, <i>i.e.</i> sinners, he borrowed an illustration from earthly
things, saying, “There is one flesh of birds, another of
fishes.” For heavenly things are worthily compared to the
saints, and earthly things to sinners. These statements are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>made in reply to those who deny the resurrection of the dead,
<i>i.e.</i> the resurrection of bodies.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. We now turn our attention to some of our own [believers],
who, either from feebleness of intellect or want of
proper instruction, adopt a very low and abject view of
the resurrection of the body. We ask these persons in what
manner they understand that an animal body is to be changed
by the grace of the resurrection, and to become a spiritual
one; and how that which is sown in weakness will arise in
power; how that which is planted in dishonour will arise
in glory; and that which was sown in corruption, will be
changed to a state of incorruption. Because if they believe
the apostle, that a body which arises in glory, and power,
and incorruptibility, has already become spiritual, it appears
absurd and contrary to his meaning to say that it can again
be entangled with the passions of flesh and blood, seeing the
apostle manifestly declares that “flesh and blood shall not
inherit the kingdom of God, nor shall corruption inherit incorruption.”
But how do they understand the declaration of
the apostle, “We shall all be changed?” This transformation
certainly is to be looked for, according to the order which we
have taught above; and in it, undoubtedly, it becomes us to
hope for something worthy of divine grace; and this we believe
will take place in the order in which the apostle describes
the sowing in the ground of a “bare grain of corn, or of any
other fruit,” to which “God gives a body as it pleases Him,”
as soon as the grain of corn is dead. For in the same way
also our bodies are to be supposed to fall into the earth like
a grain; and (that germ being implanted in them which
contains the bodily substance) although the bodies die, and
become corrupted, and are scattered abroad, yet by the word
of God, that very germ which is always safe in the substance
of the body, raises them from the earth, and restores and
repairs them, as the power which is in the grain of wheat,
after its corruption and death, repairs and restores the grain
into a body having stalk and ear. And so also to those who
shall deserve to obtain an inheritance in the kingdom of
heaven, that germ of the body’s restoration, which we have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>before mentioned, by God’s command restores out of the
earthly and animal body a spiritual one, capable of inhabiting
the heavens; while to each one of those who may be of inferior
merit, or of more abject condition, or even the lowest
in the scale, and altogether thrust aside, there is yet given,
in proportion to the dignity of his life and soul, a glory and
dignity of body,—nevertheless in such a way, that even the
body which rises again of those who are to be destined to
everlasting fire or to severe punishments, is by the very
change of the resurrection so incorruptible, that it cannot be
corrupted and dissolved even by severe punishments. If,
then, such be the qualities of that body which will arise from
the dead, let us now see what is the meaning of the threatening
of eternal fire.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. We find in the prophet Isaiah, that the fire with which
each one is punished is described as his own; for he says,
“Walk in the light of your own fire, and in the flame which
ye have kindled.”<a id='r319'></a><a href='#f319' class='c007'><sup>[319]</sup></a> By these words it seems to be indicated
that every sinner kindles for himself the flame of his own
fire, and is not plunged into some fire which has been already
kindled by another, or was in existence before himself. Of
this fire the fuel and food are our sins, which are called by
the Apostle Paul wood, and hay, and stubble.<a id='r320'></a><a href='#f320' class='c007'><sup>[320]</sup></a> And I think
that, as abundance of food, and provisions of a contrary kind
and amount, breed fevers in the body, and fevers, too, of different
sorts and duration, according to the proportion in which
the collected poison<a id='r321'></a><a href='#f321' class='c007'><sup>[321]</sup></a> supplies material and fuel for disease
(the quality of this material, gathered together from different
poisons, proving the causes either of a more acute or more
lingering disease); so, when the soul has gathered together
a multitude of evil works, and an abundance of sins against
itself, at a suitable time all that assembly of evils boils up to
punishment, and is set on fire to chastisements; when the
mind itself, or conscience, receiving by divine power into the
memory all those things of which it had stamped on itself
certain signs and forms at the moment of sinning, will see
a kind of history, as it were, of all the foul, and shameful, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>unholy deeds which it has done, exposed before its eyes:
then is the conscience itself harassed, and, pierced by its own
goads, becomes an accuser and a witness against itself. And
this, I think, was the opinion of the Apostle Paul himself,
when he said, “Their thoughts mutually accusing or excusing
them in the day when God will judge the secrets of men
by Jesus Christ, according to my gospel.”<a id='r322'></a><a href='#f322' class='c007'><sup>[322]</sup></a> From which it
is understood that around the substance of the soul certain
tortures are produced by the hurtful affections of sins themselves.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. And that the understanding of this matter may not
appear very difficult, we may draw some considerations from
the evil effects of those passions which are wont to befall
some souls, as when a soul is consumed by the fire of love,
or wasted away by zeal or envy, or when the passion of
anger is kindled, or one is consumed by the greatness of his
madness or his sorrow; on which occasions some, finding
the excess of these evils unbearable, have deemed it more
tolerable to submit to death than to endure perpetually torture
of such a kind. You will ask indeed whether, in the case of
those who have been entangled in the evils arising from those
vices above enumerated, and who, while existing in this life,
have been unable to procure any amelioration for themselves,
and have in this condition departed from the world, it be
sufficient in the way of punishment that they be tortured by
the remaining in them of these hurtful affections, <i>i.e.</i> of the
anger, or of the fury, or of the madness, or of the sorrow,
whose fatal poison was in this life lessened by no healing
medicine; or whether, these affections being changed, they
will be subjected to the pains of a general punishment. Now
I am of opinion that another species of punishment may be
understood to exist; because, as we feel that when the limbs
of the body are loosened and torn away from their mutual
supports, there is produced pain of a most excruciating kind,
so, when the soul shall be found to be beyond the order, and
connection, and harmony in which it was created by God
for the purposes of good and useful action and observation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>and not to harmonize with itself in the connection of its
rational movements, it must be deemed to bear the chastisement
and torture of its own dissension, and to feel the
punishments of its own disordered condition. And when
this dissolution and rending asunder of soul shall have been
tested by the application of fire, a solidification undoubtedly
into a firmer structure will take place, and a restoration be
effected.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. There are also many other things which escape our
notice, and are known to Him alone who is the physician of
our souls. For if, on account of those bad effects which we
bring upon ourselves by eating and drinking, we deem it
necessary for the health of the body to make use of some
unpleasant and painful drug, sometimes even, if the nature
of the disease demand, requiring the severe process of the
amputating knife; and if the virulence of the disease shall
transcend even these remedies, the evil has at last to be burned
out by fire; how much more is it to be understood that God
our Physician, desiring to remove the defects of our souls,
which they had contracted from their different sins and
crimes, should employ penal measures of this sort, and should
apply even, in addition, the punishment of fire to those who
have lost their soundness of mind! Pictures of this method
of procedure are found also in the holy Scriptures. In the
book of Deuteronomy, the divine word threatens sinners with
the punishments of fevers, and colds, and jaundice,<a id='r323'></a><a href='#f323' class='c007'><sup>[323]</sup></a> and with
the pains of feebleness of vision, and alienation of mind, and
paralysis, and blindness, and weakness of the reins. If any
one, then, at his leisure gather together out of the whole
of Scripture all the enumerations of diseases which in the
threatenings addressed to sinners are called by the names of
bodily maladies, he will find that either the vices of souls,
or their punishments, are figuratively indicated by them. To
understand now, that in the same way in which physicians
apply remedies to the sick, in order that by careful treatment
they may recover their health, God so deals towards those
who have lapsed and fallen into sin, is proved by this, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>the cup of God’s fury is ordered, through the agency of the
prophet Jeremiah,<a id='r324'></a><a href='#f324' class='c007'><sup>[324]</sup></a> to be offered to all nations, that they may
drink it, and be in a state of madness, and vomit it forth. In
doing which, He threatens them, saying, That if any one refuse
to drink, he shall not be cleansed.<a id='r325'></a><a href='#f325' class='c007'><sup>[325]</sup></a> By which certainly it is
understood that the fury of God’s vengeance is profitable for
the purgation of souls. That the punishment, also, which is
said to be applied by fire, is understood to be applied with
the object of healing, is taught by Isaiah, who speaks thus
of Israel: “The Lord will wash away the filth of the sons or
daughters of Zion, and shall purge away the blood from the
midst of them by the spirit of judgment, and the spirit of
burning.”<a id='r326'></a><a href='#f326' class='c007'><sup>[326]</sup></a> Of the Chaldeans he thus speaks: “Thou hast
the coals of fire; sit upon them: they will be to thee a help.”<a id='r327'></a><a href='#f327' class='c007'><sup>[327]</sup></a>
And in other passages he says, “The Lord will sanctify in a
burning fire;”<a id='r328'></a><a href='#f328' class='c007'><sup>[328]</sup></a> and in the prophecies of Malachi he says,
“The Lord sitting will blow, and purify, and will pour forth
the cleansed sons of Judah.”<a id='r329'></a><a href='#f329' class='c007'><sup>[329]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>7. But that fate also which is mentioned in the Gospels
as overtaking unfaithful stewards, who, it is said, are to be
divided, and a portion of them placed along with unbelievers,
as if that portion which is not their own were to be sent elsewhere,
undoubtedly indicates some kind of punishment on
those whose spirit, as it seems to me, is shown to be separated
from the soul. For if this Spirit is of divine nature, <i>i.e.</i> is
understood to be a Holy Spirit, we shall understand this to
be said of the gift of the Holy Spirit: that when, whether
by baptism, or by the grace of the Spirit, the word of
wisdom, or the word of knowledge, or of any other gift, has
been bestowed upon a man, and not rightly administered,
<i>i.e.</i> either buried in the earth or tied up in a napkin, the
gift of the Spirit will certainly be withdrawn from his soul,
and the other portion which remains, that is, the substance
of the soul, will be assigned its place with unbelievers,
being divided and separated from that Spirit with whom, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>joining itself to the Lord, it ought to have been one spirit.
Now, if this is not to be understood of the Spirit of God, but
of the nature of the soul itself, that will be called its better
part which was made in the image and likeness of God;
whereas the other part, that which afterwards, through its
fall by the exercise of free-will, was assumed contrary to the
nature of its original condition of purity,—this part, as being
the friend and beloved of matter, is punished with the fate
of unbelievers. There is also a third sense in which that
separation may be understood, this viz., that as each believer,
although the humblest in the church, is said to be attended
by an angel, who is declared by the Saviour always to behold
the face of God the Father, and as this angel was certainly
one with the object of his guardianship; so, if the latter is
rendered unworthy by his want of obedience, the angel of
God is said to be taken from him, and then that part of him—the
part, viz., which belongs to his human nature—being rent
away from the divine part, is assigned a place along with
unbelievers, because it has not faithfully observed the admonitions
of the angel allotted it by God.</p>

<p class='c006'>8. But the outer darkness, in my judgment, is to be understood
not so much of some dark atmosphere without any light,
as of those persons who, being plunged in the darkness of
profound ignorance, have been placed beyond the reach of
any light of the understanding. We must see, also, lest this
perhaps should be the meaning of the expression, that as the
saints will receive those bodies in which they have lived in
holiness and purity in the habitations of this life, bright and
glorious after the resurrection, so the wicked also, who in
this life have loved the darkness of error and the night of
ignorance, may be clothed with dark and black bodies after
the resurrection, that the very mist of ignorance which had
in this life taken possession of their minds within them, may
appear in the future as the external covering of the body.
Similar is the view to be entertained regarding the prison.
Let these remarks, which have been made as brief as possible,
that the order of our discourse in the meantime might be
preserved, suffice for the present occasion.</p>

</div>
<p class='c005'>1. Let us now briefly see what views we are to form regarding
promises.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is certain that there is no living thing which can be
altogether inactive and immoveable, but delights in motion of
every kind, and in perpetual activity and volition; and this
nature, I think it evident, is in all living things. Much more,
then, must a rational animal, <i>i.e.</i> the nature of man, be in
perpetual movement and activity. If, indeed, he is forgetful
of himself, and ignorant of what becomes him, all his efforts
are directed to serve the uses of the body, and in all his
movements he is occupied with his own pleasures and bodily
lusts; but if he be one who studies to care or provide for
the general good, then, either by consulting for the benefit of
the state or by obeying the magistrates, he exerts himself for
that, whatever it is, which may seem certainly to promote the
public advantage. And if now any one be of such a nature
as to understand that there is something better than those
things which seem to be corporeal, and so bestow his labour
upon wisdom and science, then he will undoubtedly direct all
his attention towards pursuits of that kind, that he may, by
inquiring into the truth, ascertain the causes and reason of
things. As therefore, in this life, one man deems it the
highest good to enjoy bodily pleasures, another to consult for
the benefit of the community, a third to devote attention to
study and learning; so let us inquire whether in that life
which is the true one (which is said to be hidden with Christ
in God, <i>i.e.</i> in that eternal life), there will be for us some
such order and condition of existence.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Certain persons, then, refusing the labour of thinking,
and adopting a superficial view of the letter of the law, and
yielding rather in some measure to the indulgence of their
own desires and lusts, being disciples of the letter alone, are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>of opinion that the fulfilment of the promises of the future
are to be looked for in bodily pleasure and luxury; and
therefore they especially desire to have again, after the
resurrection, such bodily structures<a id='r331'></a><a href='#f331' class='c007'><sup>[331]</sup></a> as may never be without
the power of eating, and drinking, and performing all the
functions of flesh and blood, not following the opinion of
the Apostle Paul regarding the resurrection of a spiritual
body. And consequently they say, that after the resurrection
there will be marriages, and the begetting of children,
imagining to themselves that the earthly city of Jerusalem is
to be rebuilt, its foundations laid in precious stones, and its
walls constructed of jasper, and its battlements of crystal;
that it is to have a wall composed of many precious stones,
as jasper, and sapphire, and chalcedony, and emerald, and
sardonyx, and onyx, and chrysolite, and chrysoprase, and
jacinth, and amethyst. Moreover, they think that the natives
of other countries are to be given them as the ministers of
their pleasures, whom they are to employ either as tillers of
the field or builders of walls, and by whom their ruined and
fallen city is again to be raised up; and they think that they
are to receive the wealth of the nations to live on, and that
they will have control over their riches; that even the camels
of Midian and Kedar will come, and bring to them gold, and
incense, and precious stones. And these views they think
to establish on the authority of the prophets by those promises
which are written regarding Jerusalem; and by those
passages also where it is said, that they who serve the Lord
shall eat and drink, but that sinners shall hunger and thirst;
that the righteous shall be joyful, but that sorrow shall possess
the wicked. And from the New Testament also they quote
the saying of the Saviour, in which He makes a promise to
His disciples concerning the joy of wine, saying, “Henceforth
I shall not drink of this cup, until I drink it with you
new in my Father’s kingdom.”<a id='r332'></a><a href='#f332' class='c007'><sup>[332]</sup></a> They add, moreover, that
declaration, in which the Saviour calls those blessed who
now hunger and thirst,<a id='r333'></a><a href='#f333' class='c007'><sup>[333]</sup></a> promising them that they shall be
satisfied; and many other scriptural illustrations are adduced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>by them, the meaning of which they do not perceive is to be
taken figuratively. Then, again, agreeably to the form of
things in this life, and according to the gradations of the
dignities or ranks in this world, or the greatness of their
powers, they think they are to be kings and princes, like
those earthly monarchs who now exist; chiefly, as it appears,
on account of that expression in the Gospel: “Have thou
power over five cities.”<a id='r334'></a><a href='#f334' class='c007'><sup>[334]</sup></a> And to speak shortly, according to
the manner of things in this life in all similar matters, do
they desire the fulfilment of all things looked for in the promises,
viz. that what now is should exist again. Such are
the views of those who, while believing in Christ, understand
the divine Scriptures in a sort of Jewish sense, drawing
from them nothing worthy of the divine promises.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. Those, however, who receive the representations of
Scripture according to the understanding of the apostles,
entertain the hope that the saints will eat indeed, but that it
will be the bread of life, which may nourish the soul with
the food of truth and wisdom, and enlighten the mind, and
cause it to drink from the cup of divine wisdom, according
to the declaration of holy Scripture: “Wisdom has prepared
her table, she has killed her beasts, she has mingled her wine
in her cup, and she cries with a loud voice, Come to me,
eat the bread which I have prepared for you, and drink the
wine which I have mingled.”<a id='r335'></a><a href='#f335' class='c007'><sup>[335]</sup></a> By this food of wisdom, the
understanding, being nourished to an entire and perfect condition
like that in which man was made at the beginning, is
restored to the image and likeness of God; so that, although
an individual may depart from this life less perfectly instructed,
but who has done works that are approved of,<a id='r336'></a><a href='#f336' class='c007'><sup>[336]</sup></a> he
will be capable of receiving instruction in that Jerusalem,
the city of the saints, <i>i.e.</i> he will be educated and moulded,
and made a living stone, a stone elect and precious, because
he has undergone with firmness and constancy the struggles
of life and the trials of piety; and will there come to a truer
and clearer knowledge of that which here has been already
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>predicted, viz. that “man shall not live by bread alone, but
by every word which proceedeth from the mouth of God.”<a id='r337'></a><a href='#f337' class='c007'><sup>[337]</sup></a>
And they also are to be understood to be the princes and
rulers who both govern those of lower rank, and instruct
them, and teach them, and train them to divine things.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. But if these views should not appear to fill the minds
of those who hope for such results with a becoming desire,
let us go back a little, and, irrespective of the natural and
innate longing of the mind for the thing itself, let us make
inquiry so that we may be able at last to describe, as it were,
the very forms of the bread of life, and the quality of that
wine, and the peculiar nature of the principalities, all in conformity
with the spiritual view of things.<a id='r338'></a><a href='#f338' class='c007'><sup>[338]</sup></a> Now, as in those
arts which are usually performed by means of manual labour,
the reason why a thing is done, or why it is of a special
quality, or for a special purpose, is an object of investigation
to the mind,<a id='r339'></a><a href='#f339' class='c007'><sup>[339]</sup></a> while the actual work itself is unfolded to view
by the agency of the hands; so, in those works of God which
were created by Him, it is to be observed that the reason and
understanding of those things which we see done by Him
remains undisclosed. And as, when our eye beholds the
products of an artist’s labour, the mind, immediately on perceiving
anything of unusual artistic excellence, burns to know
of what nature it is, or how it was formed, or to what purposes
it was fashioned; so, in a much greater degree, and in one
that is beyond all comparison, does the mind burn with an
inexpressible desire to know the reason of those things which
we see done by God. This desire, this longing, we believe to
be unquestionably implanted within us by God; and as the
eye naturally seeks the light and vision, and our body naturally
desires food and drink, so our mind is possessed with a
becoming and natural desire to become acquainted with the
truth of God and the causes of things. Now we have received
this desire from God, not in order that it should never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>be gratified or be <i>capable</i> of gratification; otherwise the love
of truth would appear to have been implanted by God into
our minds to no purpose, if it were never to have an opportunity
of satisfaction. Whence also, even in this life, those
who devote themselves with great labour to the pursuits of
piety and religion, although obtaining only some small fragments
from the numerous and immense treasures of divine
knowledge, yet, by the very circumstance that their mind
and soul is engaged in these pursuits, and that in the eagerness
of their desire they outstrip themselves, do they derive
much advantage; and, because their minds are directed to
the study and love of the investigation of truth, are they
made fitter for receiving the instruction that is to come; as
if, when one would paint an image, he were first with a light
pencil to trace out the outlines of the coming picture, and
prepare marks for the reception of the features that are to be
afterwards added, this preliminary sketch in outline is found
to prepare the way for the laying on of the true colours of
the painting; so, in a measure, an outline and sketch may be
traced on the tablets of our heart by the pencil of our Lord
Jesus Christ. And therefore perhaps is it said, “Unto every
one that hath shall be given, and be added.”<a id='r340'></a><a href='#f340' class='c007'><sup>[340]</sup></a> By which
it is established, that to those who possess in this life a kind
of outline of truth and knowledge, shall be added the beauty
of a perfect image in the future.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. Some such desire, I apprehend, was indicated by him
who said, “I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to
depart, and to be with Christ, which is far better;”<a id='r341'></a><a href='#f341' class='c007'><sup>[341]</sup></a> knowing
that when he should have returned to Christ he would then
know more clearly the reasons of all things which are done
on earth, either respecting man, or the soul of man, or the
mind; or regarding any other subject, such as, for instance,
what is the Spirit that operates, what also is the vital spirit, or
what is the grace of the Holy Spirit that is given to believers.
Then also will he understand what Israel appears to be, or what
is meant by the diversity of nations; what the twelve tribes
of Israel mean, and what the individual people of each tribe.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>Then, too, will he understand the reason of the priests and
Levites, and of the different priestly orders, the type of
which was in Moses, and also what is the true meaning of
the jubilees, and of the weeks of years with God. He will
see also the reasons for the festival days, and holy days,
and for all the sacrifices and purifications. He will perceive
also the reason of the purgation from leprosy, and what the
different kinds of leprosy are, and the reason of the purgation
of those who lose their seed. He will come to know, moreover,
what are the good influences,<a id='r342'></a><a href='#f342' class='c007'><sup>[342]</sup></a> and their greatness, and their
qualities; and those too which are of a contrary kind, and
what the affection of the former, and what the strife-causing
emulation of the latter is towards men. He will behold also
the nature of the soul, and the diversity of animals (whether
of those which live in the water, or of birds, or of wild
beasts), and why each of the genera is subdivided into so
many species; and what intention of the Creator, or what
purpose of His wisdom, is concealed in each individual thing.
He will become acquainted, too, with the reason why certain
properties are found associated with certain roots or herbs,
and why, on the other hand, evil effects are averted by other
herbs and roots. He will know, moreover, the nature of the
apostate angels, and the reason why they have power to flatter
in some things those who do not despise them with the whole
power of faith, and why they exist for the purpose of deceiving
and leading men astray. He will learn, too, the judgment
of Divine Providence on each individual thing; and that, of
those events which happen to men, none occur by accident or
chance, but in accordance with a plan so carefully considered,
and so stupendous, that it does not overlook even the number
of the hairs of the heads, not merely of the saints, but perhaps
of all human beings, and the plan of which providential
government extends even to caring for the sale of two sparrows
for a denarius, whether sparrows there be understood figuratively
or literally. Now indeed this providential government
is still a subject of investigation, but then it will be fully
manifested. From all which we are to suppose, that meanwhile
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>not a little time may pass by until the reason of those
things only which are upon the earth be pointed out to the
worthy and deserving after their departure from life, that by
the knowledge of all these things, and by the grace of full
knowledge, they may enjoy an unspeakable joy. Then, if
that atmosphere which is between heaven and earth is not
devoid of inhabitants, and those of a rational kind, as the
apostle says, “Wherein in times past ye walked according to
the course of this world, according to the prince of the power
of the air, the spirit who now worketh in the children of
disobedience.”<a id='r343'></a><a href='#f343' class='c007'><sup>[343]</sup></a> And again he says, “We shall be caught
up in the clouds to meet Christ in the air, and so shall we
ever be with the Lord.”<a id='r344'></a><a href='#f344' class='c007'><sup>[344]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>6. We are therefore to suppose that the saints will remain
there until they recognise the twofold mode of government
in those things which are performed in the air. And when
I say “twofold mode,” I mean this: When we were upon
earth, we saw either animals or trees, and beheld the differences
among them, and also the very great diversity among
men; but although we saw these things, we did not understand
the reason of them; and this only was suggested to us
from the visible diversity, that we should examine and inquire
upon what principle these things were either created or
diversely arranged. And a zeal or desire for knowledge of
this kind being conceived by us on earth, the full understanding
and comprehension of it will be granted after death, if
indeed the result should follow according to our expectations.
When, therefore, we shall have fully comprehended its nature,
we shall understand in a twofold manner what we saw on
earth. Some such view, then, must we hold regarding this
abode in the air. I think, therefore, that all the saints who
depart from this life will remain in some place situated on
the earth, which holy Scripture calls paradise, as in some
place of instruction, and, so to speak, class-room or school of
souls, in which they are to be instructed regarding all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>things which they had seen on earth, and are to receive also
some information respecting things that are to follow in the
future, as even when in this life they had obtained in some
degree indications of future events, although “through a
glass darkly,” all of which are revealed more clearly and distinctly
to the saints in their proper time and place. If any
one indeed be pure in heart, and holy in mind, and more
practised in perception, he will, by making more rapid progress,
quickly ascend to a place in the air, and reach the
kingdom of heaven, through those mansions, so to speak, in
the various places which the Greeks have termed spheres, <i>i.e.</i>
globes, but which holy Scripture has called heavens; in each
of which he will first see clearly what is done there, and in
the second place, will discover the reason why things are so
done: and thus he will in order pass through all gradations,
following Him who hath passed into the heavens, Jesus the
Son of God, who said, “I will that where I am, these may be
also.”<a id='r345'></a><a href='#f345' class='c007'><sup>[345]</sup></a> And of this diversity of places He speaks, when He
says, “In my Father’s house are many mansions.” He Himself
is everywhere, and passes swiftly through all things; nor
are we any longer to understand Him as existing in those
narrow limits in which He was once confined for our sakes,
<i>i.e.</i> not in that circumscribed body which He occupied on
earth, when dwelling among men, according to which He
might be considered as enclosed in some one place.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. When, then, the saints shall have reached the celestial
abodes, they will clearly see the nature of the stars one by
one, and will understand whether they are endued with life,
or their condition, whatever it is. And they will comprehend
also the other reasons for the works of God, which He Himself
will reveal to them. For He will show to them, as to
children, the causes of things and the power of His creation,<a id='r346'></a><a href='#f346' class='c007'><sup>[346]</sup></a>
and will explain why that star was placed in that particular
quarter of the sky, and why it was separated from another
by so great an intervening space; what, <i>e.g.</i>, would have been
the consequence if it had been nearer or more remote; or if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>that star had been larger than this, how the totality of things
would not have remained the same, but all would have been
transformed into a different condition of being. And so,
when they have finished all those matters which are connected
with the stars, and with the heavenly revolutions, they will
come to those which are not seen, or to those whose names
only we have heard, and to things which are invisible, which
the Apostle Paul has informed us are numerous, although
what they are, or what difference may exist among them, we
cannot even conjecture by our feeble intellect. And thus
the rational nature, growing by each individual step, not as it
grew in this life in flesh, and body, and soul, but enlarged in
understanding and in power of perception, is raised as a mind
already perfect to perfect knowledge, no longer at all impeded
by those carnal senses, but increased in intellectual growth;
and ever gazing purely, and, so to speak, face to face, on the
causes of things, it attains perfection, firstly, viz. that by which
it ascends to [the truth],<a id='r347'></a><a href='#f347' class='c007'><sup>[347]</sup></a> and secondly, that by which it abides
in it, having problems and the understanding of things, and
the causes of events, as the food on which it may feast. For
as in this life our bodies grow physically to what they are,
through a sufficiency of food in early life supplying the
means of increase, but after the due height has been attained
we use food no longer to grow, but to live, and to be preserved
in life by it; so also I think that the mind, when it
has attained perfection, eats and avails itself of suitable and
appropriate food in such a degree, that nothing ought to be
either deficient or superfluous. And in all things this food
is to be understood as the contemplation and understanding
of God, which is of a measure appropriate and suitable to this
nature, which was made and created; and this measure it
is proper should be observed by every one of those who are
beginning to see God, <i>i.e.</i> to understand Him through purity
of heart.</p>

<h4 id='de-principiis-b3-preface' class='c009'>PREFACE OF RUFINUS.</h4>
<p class='c005'>Reader, remember me in your prayers, that we
too may deserve to be made emulators of the
spirit. The two former books on <i>The Principles</i>
I translated not only at your instance, but even
under pressure from you during the days of Lent;<a id='r348'></a><a href='#f348' class='c007'><sup>[348]</sup></a> but
as you, my devout brother Macarius, were not only living
near me during that time, but had more leisure at your
command than now, so I also worked the harder; whereas I
have been longer in explaining these two latter books, seeing
you came less frequently from a distant extremity of the
city to urge on my labour. Now if you remember what I
warned you of in my former preface,—that certain persons
would be indignant, if they did not hear that we spoke some
evil of Origen,—that, I imagine, you have forthwith experienced,
has come to pass. But if those demons<a id='r349'></a><a href='#f349' class='c007'><sup>[349]</sup></a> who excite
the tongues of men to slander were so infuriated by that
work, in which he had not as yet fully unveiled their secret
proceedings, what, think you, will be the case in this, in
which he will expose all those dark and hidden ways, by
which they creep into the hearts of men, and deceive weak
and unstable souls? You will immediately see all things
thrown into confusion, seditions stirred up, clamours raised
throughout the whole city, and that individual summoned to
receive sentence of condemnation who endeavoured to dispel
the diabolical darkness of ignorance by means of the light
of the gospel lamp.<a id='r350'></a><a href='#f350' class='c007'><sup>[350]</sup></a> Let such things, however, be lightly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>esteemed by him who is desirous of being trained in divine
learning, while retaining in its integrity the rule of the
Catholic faith.<a id='r351'></a><a href='#f351' class='c007'><sup>[351]</sup></a> I think it necessary, however, to remind
you that the principle observed in the former books has been
observed also in these, viz. not to translate what appeared
contrary to Origen’s other opinions, and to our own belief,
but to pass by such passages as being interpolated and forged
by others. But if he has appeared to give expression to any
novelties regarding rational creatures (on which subject the
essence of our faith does not depend), for the sake of discussion
and of adding to our knowledge, when perhaps it was
necessary for us to answer in such an order some heretical
opinions, I have not omitted to mention these either in the
present or preceding books, unless when he wished to repeat
in the following books what he had already stated in the
previous ones, when I have thought it convenient, for the
sake of brevity, to curtail some of these repetitions. Should
any one, however, peruse these passages from a desire to
enlarge his knowledge, and not to raise captious objections,
he will do better to have them expounded by persons of skill.
For it is an absurdity to have the fictions of poetry and the
ridiculous plays of comedy<a id='r352'></a><a href='#f352' class='c007'><sup>[352]</sup></a> interpreted by grammarians, and
to suppose that without a master and an interpreter any one
is able to learn those things which are spoken either of God
or of the heavenly virtues, and of the whole universe of
things, in which some deplorable error either of pagan philosophers
or of heretics is confuted; and the result of which
is, that men would rather rashly and ignorantly condemn
things that are difficult and obscure, than ascertain their
meaning by diligence and study.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>TRANSLATED FROM LATIN OF RUFINUS. <br> CHAPTER <abbr title='one'>I.</abbr> <br> ON THE FREEDOM OF THE WILL.<a id='r353'></a><a href='#f353' class='c007'><sup>[353]</sup></a></h4>
<p class='c005'>1. Some such opinions, we believe, ought to be entertained
regarding the divine promises, when we direct our understanding
to the contemplation of that eternal and infinite
world, and gaze on its ineffable joy and blessedness. But as
the preaching of the church includes a belief in a future and
just judgment of God, which belief incites and persuades
men to a good and virtuous life, and to an avoidance of sin
by all possible means; and as by this it is undoubtedly indicated
that it is within our own power to devote ourselves
either to a life that is worthy of praise, or to one that is
worthy of censure, I therefore deem it necessary to say a few
words regarding the freedom of the will, seeing that this
topic has been treated by very many writers in no mean
style. And that we may ascertain more easily what is the
freedom of the will, let us inquire into the nature of will
and of desire.<a id='r354'></a><a href='#f354' class='c007'><sup>[354]</sup></a></p>
<h4 class='c009'>TRANSLATION FROM THE GREEK. <br> CHAPTER <abbr title='one'>I.</abbr> <br> ON THE FREEDOM OF THE WILL<a id='r355'></a><a href='#f355' class='c007'><sup>[355]</sup></a>, WITH AN EXPLANATION AND INTERPRETATION OF THOSE STATEMENTS OF SCRIPTURE WHICH APPEAR TO NULLIFY IT.</h4>
<p class='c005'>1. Since in the preaching of the church there is included
the doctrine respecting a just judgment of God, which, when
believed to be true, incites those who hear it to live virtuously,
and to shun sin by all means, inasmuch as they manifestly
acknowledge that things worthy of praise and blame are
within our own power, come and let us discuss by themselves
a few points regarding the freedom of the will—a question
of all others most necessary. And that we may understand
what the freedom of the will is, it is necessary to unfold the
conception of it,<a id='r356'></a><a href='#f356' class='c007'><sup>[356]</sup></a> that this being declared with precision, the
subject may be placed before us.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>FROM THE LATIN.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c005'>2. Of all things which move, some have the cause of their
motion within themselves, others receive it from without:
and all those things only are moved from without which are
without life, as stones, and pieces of wood, and whatever
things are of such a nature as to be held together by the constitution
of their matter alone, or of their bodily substance.<a id='r357'></a><a href='#f357' class='c007'><sup>[357]</sup></a>
That view must indeed be dismissed which would regard
the dissolution of bodies by corruption as motion, for it has
no bearing upon our present purpose. Others, again, have
the cause of motion in themselves, as animals, or trees, and
all things which are held together by natural life or soul;
among which some think ought to be classed the veins of
metals. Fire, also, is supposed to be the cause of its own
motion, and perhaps also springs of water. And of those
things which have the causes of their motion in themselves,
some are said to be moved out of themselves, others by themselves.
And they so distinguish them, because those things
are moved out of themselves which are alive indeed, but
have no soul;<a id='r358'></a><a href='#f358' class='c007'><sup>[358]</sup></a> whereas those things which have a soul are
moved by themselves, when a phantasy,<a id='r359'></a><a href='#f359' class='c007'><sup>[359]</sup></a> <i>i.e.</i> a desire or incitement,
is presented to them, which excites them to move
towards something. Finally, in certain things endowed with
a soul, there is such a phantasy, <i>i.e.</i> a will or feeling,<a id='r360'></a><a href='#f360' class='c007'><sup>[360]</sup></a> as by
a kind of natural instinct calls them forth, and arouses them
to orderly and regular motion; as we see to be the case with
spiders, which are stirred up in a most orderly manner by a
phantasy, <i>i.e.</i> a sort of wish and desire for weaving, to undertake
the production of a web, some natural movement undoubtedly
calling forth the effort to work of this kind. Nor
is this very insect found to possess any other feeling than the
natural desire of weaving; as in like manner bees also exhibit
a desire to form honeycombs, and to collect, as they say, aerial
honey.<a id='r361'></a><a href='#f361' class='c007'><sup>[361]</sup></a></p>
<h4 class='c009'>FROM THE GREEK.</h4>
<p class='c005'>2. Of things that move, some have the cause of their
motion within themselves; others, again, are moved only
from without. Now only portable things are moved from
without, such as pieces of wood, and stones, and all matter that
is held together by their constitution alone.<a id='r362'></a><a href='#f362' class='c007'><sup>[362]</sup></a> And let that view
be removed from consideration which calls the flux of bodies
motion, since it is not needed for our present purpose. But
animals and plants have the cause of their motion within
themselves, and in general whatever is held together by
nature and a soul, to which class of things they say that
metals also belong. And besides these, fire too is self-moved,
and perhaps also fountains of water. Now, of those things
which have the cause of their movement within themselves,
some, they say, are moved out of themselves, others from
themselves: things without life, out of themselves; animate
things, from themselves. For animate things are moved from
themselves, a phantasy<a id='r363'></a><a href='#f363' class='c007'><sup>[363]</sup></a> springing up in them which incites
to effort. And again, in certain animals phantasies are
formed which call forth an effort, the nature of the phantasy<a id='r364'></a><a href='#f364' class='c007'><sup>[364]</sup></a>
stirring up the effort in an orderly manner, as in the spider
is formed the phantasy of weaving; and the attempt to weave
follows, the nature of its phantasy inciting the insect in an
orderly manner to this alone. And besides its phantasial
nature, nothing else is believed to belong to the insect.<a id='r365'></a><a href='#f365' class='c007'><sup>[365]</sup></a> And
in the bee there is formed the phantasy to produce wax.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>FROM THE LATIN.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c005'>3. But since a rational animal not only has within itself
these natural movements, but has moreover, to a greater extent
than other animals, the power of reason, by which it can
judge and determine regarding natural movements, and disapprove
and reject some, while approving and adopting others,
so by the judgment of this reason may the movements of men
be governed and directed towards a commendable life. And
from this it follows that, since the nature of this reason which
is in man has within itself the power of distinguishing between
good and evil, and while distinguishing possesses the faculty
of selecting what it has approved, it may justly be deemed
worthy of praise in choosing what is good, and deserving of
censure in following that which is base or wicked. This indeed
must by no means escape our notice, that in some dumb
animals there is found a more regular movement<a id='r366'></a><a href='#f366' class='c007'><sup>[366]</sup></a> than in
others, as in hunting-dogs or war-horses, so that they may
appear to some to be moved by a kind of rational sense. But
we must believe this to be the result not so much of reason as
of some natural instinct,<a id='r367'></a><a href='#f367' class='c007'><sup>[367]</sup></a> largely bestowed for purposes of
that kind. Now, as we had begun to remark, seeing that
such is the nature of a rational animal, some things may
happen to us human beings from without; and these, coming
in contact with our sense of sight, or hearing, or any other of
our senses, may incite and arouse us to good movements, or
the contrary; and seeing they come to us from an external
source, it is not within our own power to prevent their coming.
But to determine and approve what use we ought to
make of those things which thus happen, is the duty of no
other than of that reason within us, <i>i.e.</i> of our own judgment;
by the decision of which reason we use the incitement,
which comes to us from without for that purpose, which reason
approves, our natural movements being determined by its
authority either to good actions or the reverse.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>FROM THE GREEK.</h4>
<p class='c005'>3. The rational animal, however, has, in addition to its
phantasial nature, also reason, which judges the phantasies,
and disapproves of some and accepts others, in order that the
animal may be led according to them. Therefore, since
there are in the nature of reason aids towards the contemplation
of virtue and vice, by following which, after beholding
good and evil, we select the one and avoid the other, we are
deserving of praise when we give ourselves to the practice of
virtue, and censurable when we do the reverse. We must
not, however, be ignorant that the greater part of the nature
assigned to all things is a varying quantity<a id='r368'></a><a href='#f368' class='c007'><sup>[368]</sup></a> among animals,
both in a greater and a less degree; so that the instinct in
hunting-dogs and in war-horses approaches somehow, so to
speak, to the faculty of reason. Now, to fall under some
one of those external causes which stir up within us this
phantasy or that, is confessedly not one of those things that
are dependent upon ourselves; but to determine that we shall
use the occurrence in this way or differently, is the prerogative
of nothing else than of the reason within us, which, as
occasion offers,<a id='r369'></a><a href='#f369' class='c007'><sup>[369]</sup></a> arouses us towards efforts inciting to what is
virtuous and becoming, or turns us aside to what is the
reverse.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>FROM THE LATIN.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c005'>4. If any one now were to say that those things which
happen to us from an external cause, and call forth our
movements, are of such a nature that it is impossible to resist
them, whether they incite us to good or evil, let the holder of
this opinion turn his attention for a little upon himself, and
carefully inspect the movements of his own mind, unless he
has discovered already, that when an enticement to any desire
arises, nothing is accomplished until the assent of the soul is
gained, and the authority of the mind has granted indulgence
to the wicked suggestion; so that a claim might seem to be
made by two parties on certain probable grounds as to a
judge residing within the tribunals of our heart, in order that,
after the statement of reasons, the decree of execution may
proceed from the judgment of reason.<a id='r370'></a><a href='#f370' class='c007'><sup>[370]</sup></a> For, to take an illustration:
if, to a man who has determined to live continently
and chastely, and to keep himself free from all pollution with
women, a woman should happen to present herself, inciting
and alluring him to act contrary to his purpose, that woman
is not a complete and absolute cause or necessity of his
transgressing,<a id='r371'></a><a href='#f371' class='c007'><sup>[371]</sup></a> since it is in his power, by remembering his
resolution, to bridle the incitements to lust, and by the stern
admonitions of virtue to restrain the pleasure of the allurement
that solicits him; so that, all feeling of indulgence
being driven away, his determination may remain firm and
enduring. Finally, if to any men of learning, strengthened
by divine training, allurements of that kind present themselves,
remembering forthwith what they are, and calling
to mind what has long been the subject of their meditation
and instruction, and fortifying themselves by the support of
a holier doctrine, they reject and repel all incitement to
pleasure, and drive away opposing lusts by the interposition
of the reason implanted within them.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>FROM THE GREEK.</h4>
<p class='c005'>4. But if any one maintain that this very external cause
is of such a nature that it is impossible to resist it when it
comes in such a way, let him turn his attention to his own
feelings and movements, [and see] whether there is not an
approval, and assent, and inclination of the controlling principle
towards some object on account of some specious arguments.<a id='r372'></a><a href='#f372' class='c007'><sup>[372]</sup></a>
For, to take an instance, a woman who has appeared
before a man that has determined to be chaste, and to refrain
from carnal intercourse, and who has incited him to act contrary
to his purpose, is not a perfect<a id='r373'></a><a href='#f373' class='c007'><sup>[373]</sup></a> cause of annulling his
determination. For, being altogether pleased with the luxury
and allurement of the pleasure, and not wishing to resist it,
or to keep his purpose, he commits an act of licentiousness.
Another man, again (when the same things have happened
to him who has received more instruction, and has disciplined
himself<a id='r374'></a><a href='#f374' class='c007'><sup>[374]</sup></a>), encounters, indeed, allurements and enticements;
but his reason, as being strengthened to a higher point, and
carefully trained, and confirmed in its views towards a virtuous
course, or being near to confirmation,<a id='r375'></a><a href='#f375' class='c007'><sup>[375]</sup></a> repels the incitement,
and extinguishes the desire.</p>

</div>
<p class='c005'>5. Seeing, then, that these positions are thus established
by a sort of natural evidence, is it not superfluous to throw
back the causes of our actions on those things which happen
to us from without, and thus transfer the blame from ourselves,
on whom it wholly lies? For this is to say that we
are like pieces of wood, or stones, which have no motion in
themselves, but receive the causes of their motion from without.
Now such an assertion is neither true nor becoming,
and is invented only that the freedom of the will may be
denied; unless, indeed, we are to suppose that the freedom
of the will consists in this, that nothing which happens to us
from without can incite us to good or evil. And if any one
were to refer the causes of our faults to the natural disorder<a id='r376'></a><a href='#f376' class='c007'><sup>[376]</sup></a>
of the body, such a theory is proved to be contrary to the
reason of all teaching.<a id='r377'></a><a href='#f377' class='c007'><sup>[377]</sup></a> For, as we see in very many individuals,
that after living unchastely and intemperately, and
after being the captives of luxury and lust, if they should
happen to be aroused by the word of teaching and instruction
to enter upon a better course of life, there takes place
so great a change, that from being luxurious and wicked
men, they are converted into those who are sober, and most
chaste and gentle; so, again, we see in the case of those who
are quiet and honest, that after associating with restless and
shameless individuals, their good morals are corrupted by
evil conversation, and they become like those whose wickedness
is complete.<a id='r378'></a><a href='#f378' class='c007'><sup>[378]</sup></a> And this is the case sometimes with men
of mature age, so that such have lived more chastely in youth
than when more advanced years have enabled them to
indulge in a freer mode of life. The result of our reasoning,
therefore, is to show that those things which happen to us
from without are not in our own power; but that to make
a good or bad use of those things which do so happen, by help
of that reason which is within us, and which distinguishes
and determines how these things ought to be used, <i>is</i> within
our power.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>FROM THE GREEK.</h4>
<p class='c005'>5. Such being the case, to say that we are moved from
without, and to put away the blame from ourselves, by declaring
that we are like to pieces of wood and stones, which
are dragged about by those causes that act upon them from
without, is neither true nor in conformity with reason, but is
the statement of him who wishes to destroy<a id='r379'></a><a href='#f379' class='c007'><sup>[379]</sup></a> the conception of
free-will. For if we were to ask such an one what was free-will,
he would say that it consisted in this, that when purposing
to do some thing, no external cause came inciting to
the reverse. But to blame, on the other hand, the mere constitution
of the body,<a id='r380'></a><a href='#f380' class='c007'><sup>[380]</sup></a> is absurd; for the disciplinary reason,<a id='r381'></a><a href='#f381' class='c007'><sup>[381]</sup></a>
taking hold of those who are most intemperate and savage
(if they will follow her exhortation), effects a transformation,
so that the alteration and change for the better is most extensive,—the
most licentious men frequently becoming better
than those who formerly did not seem to be such by nature;
and the most savage men passing into such a state of mildness,<a id='r382'></a><a href='#f382' class='c007'><sup>[382]</sup></a>
that those persons who never at any time were so savage
as they were, appear savage in comparison, so great a degree
of gentleness having been produced within them. And we
see other men, most steady and respectable, driven from their
state of respectability and steadiness by intercourse with evil
customs, so as to fall into habits of licentiousness, often beginning
their wickedness in middle age, and plunging into
disorder after the period of youth has passed, which, so far
as its nature is concerned, is unstable. Reason, therefore,
demonstrates that external events do not depend on us, but
that it is our own business to use them in this way or the
opposite, having received reason as a judge and an investigator<a id='r383'></a><a href='#f383' class='c007'><sup>[383]</sup></a>
of the manner in which we ought to meet those events
that come from without.</p>

<p class='c005'>6. And now, to confirm the deductions of reason by the
authority of Scripture—viz. that it is our own doing whether
we live rightly or not, and that we are not compelled, either
by those causes which come to us from without, or, as some
think, by the presence of fate—we adduce the testimony of
the prophet Micah, in these words: “If it has been announced
to thee, O man, what is good, or what the Lord
requires of thee, except that thou shouldst do justice, and
love mercy, and be ready to walk with the Lord thy God.”<a id='r384'></a><a href='#f384' class='c007'><sup>[384]</sup></a>
Moses also speaks as follows: “I have placed before thy
face the way of life and the way of death: choose what is
good, and walk in it.”<a id='r385'></a><a href='#f385' class='c007'><sup>[385]</sup></a> Isaiah, moreover, makes this declaration:
“If you are willing, and hear me, ye shall eat the
good of the land. But if you be unwilling, and will not hear
me, the sword shall consume you; for the mouth of the Lord
has spoken this.”<a id='r386'></a><a href='#f386' class='c007'><sup>[386]</sup></a> In the psalm, too, it is written: “If my
people had heard me, if Israel had walked in my ways, I
would have humbled her enemies to nothing;”<a id='r387'></a><a href='#f387' class='c007'><sup>[387]</sup></a> by which
he shows that it was in the power of the people to hear, and
to walk in the ways of God. The Saviour also saying, “I
say unto you, Resist not evil;”<a id='r388'></a><a href='#f388' class='c007'><sup>[388]</sup></a> and, “Whoever shall be
angry with his brother, shall be in danger of the judgment;”<a id='r389'></a><a href='#f389' class='c007'><sup>[389]</sup></a>
and, “Whosoever shall look upon a woman to lust
after her, hath already committed adultery with her in his
heart;”<a id='r390'></a><a href='#f390' class='c007'><sup>[390]</sup></a> and in issuing certain other commands,—conveys
no other meaning than this, that it is in our own power to
observe what is commanded. And therefore we are rightly
rendered liable to condemnation if we transgress those commandments
which we are able to keep. And hence He
Himself also declares: “Every one who hears my words,
and doeth them, I will show to whom he is like: he is like a
wise man who built his house upon a rock,” etc.<a id='r391'></a><a href='#f391' class='c007'><sup>[391]</sup></a> So also
the declaration: “Whoso heareth these things, and doeth
them not, is like a foolish man, who built his house upon
the sand,” etc.<a id='r392'></a><a href='#f392' class='c007'><sup>[392]</sup></a> Even the words addressed to those who are
on His right hand, “Come unto me, all ye blessed of my
Father,” etc.; “for I was an hungered, and ye gave me to
eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink,”<a id='r393'></a><a href='#f393' class='c007'><sup>[393]</sup></a> manifestly show
that it depended upon themselves, that either these should
be deserving of praise for doing what was commanded and
receiving what was promised, or those deserving of censure
who either heard or received the contrary, and to whom it
was said, “Depart, ye cursed, into everlasting fire.” Let
us observe also, that the Apostle Paul addresses us as having
power over our own will, and as possessing in ourselves the
causes either of our salvation or of our ruin: “Dost thou
despise the riches of His goodness, and of His patience, and
of His long-suffering, not knowing that the goodness of God
leadeth thee to repentance? But, according to thy hardness
and impenitent heart, thou art treasuring up for thyself
wrath on the day of judgment and of the revelation of the
just judgment of God, who will render to every one according
to his work: to those who by patient continuance in well-doing
seek for glory and immortality, eternal life;<a id='r394'></a><a href='#f394' class='c007'><sup>[394]</sup></a> while
to those who are contentious, and believe not the truth, but
who believe iniquity, anger, indignation, tribulation, and distress,
on every soul of man that worketh evil, on the Jew
first, and [afterwards] on the Greek; but glory, and honour,
and peace to every one that doeth good, to the Jew first,
and [afterwards] to the Greek.”<a id='r395'></a><a href='#f395' class='c007'><sup>[395]</sup></a> You will find also innumerable
other passages in Holy Scripture, which manifestly
show that we possess freedom of will. Otherwise there
would be a contrariety in commandments being given us, by
observing which we may be saved, or by transgressing which
we may be condemned, if the power of keeping them were
not implanted in us.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>FROM THE GREEK.</h4>
<p class='c005'>6. Now, that it is our business to live virtuously, and that
God asks this of us, as not being dependent on Him nor on
any other, nor, as some think, upon fate, but as being our own
doing, the prophet Micah will prove when he says: “If it
has been announced to thee, O man, what is good, or what
does the Lord require of thee, except to do justice and to
love mercy?”<a id='r396'></a><a href='#f396' class='c007'><sup>[396]</sup></a> Moses also: “I have placed before thy face

and will not hear me, the sword will consume you: for the
mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.”<a id='r398'></a><a href='#f398' class='c007'><sup>[398]</sup></a> And in the Psalms:
“If my people had heard me, and Israel had walked in my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>ways, I would have humbled their enemies to nothing, and
laid my hand upon those that afflicted them;”<a id='r399'></a><a href='#f399' class='c007'><sup>[399]</sup></a> showing that
it was in the power of His people to hear and to walk in the
ways of God. And the Saviour also, when He commands,
“But I say unto you, Resist not evil;”<a id='r400'></a><a href='#f400' class='c007'><sup>[400]</sup></a> and, “Whosoever
shall be angry with his brother, shall be in danger of the
judgment;”<a id='r401'></a><a href='#f401' class='c007'><sup>[401]</sup></a> and, “Whosoever shall look upon a woman to
lust after her, hath already committed adultery with her in
his heart;”<a id='r402'></a><a href='#f402' class='c007'><sup>[402]</sup></a> and by any other commandment which He
gives, declares that it lies with ourselves to keep what is
enjoined, and that we shall reasonably<a id='r403'></a><a href='#f403' class='c007'><sup>[403]</sup></a> be liable to condemnation
if we transgress. And therefore He says in addition:
“He that heareth my words, and doeth them, shall be likened
to a prudent man, who built his house upon a rock,” etc. etc.;
“while he that heareth them, but doeth them not, is like a
foolish man, who built his house upon the sand,” etc.<a id='r404'></a><a href='#f404' class='c007'><sup>[404]</sup></a> And
when He says to those on His right hand, “Come, ye blessed
of my Father,” etc.; “for I was an hungered, and ye gave
me to eat; I was athirst, and ye gave me to drink,”<a id='r405'></a><a href='#f405' class='c007'><sup>[405]</sup></a> it is
exceedingly manifest that He gives the promises to these
as being deserving of praise. But, on the contrary, to the
others, as being censurable in comparison with them, He
says, “Depart, ye cursed, into everlasting fire!”<a id='r406'></a><a href='#f406' class='c007'><sup>[406]</sup></a> And let
us observe how Paul also converses<a id='r407'></a><a href='#f407' class='c007'><sup>[407]</sup></a> with us as having freedom
of will, and as being ourselves the cause of ruin or salvation,
when he says, “Dost thou despise the riches of His
goodness, and of His patience, and of His long-suffering; not
knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?
But, according to thy hardness and impenitent heart,
thou art treasuring up for thyself wrath on the day of wrath
and revelation of the righteous judgment of God; who will
render to every one according to his works: to those who, by
patient continuance in well-doing, seek for glory and immortality,
eternal life; while to those who are contentious, and
believe not the truth, but who believe iniquity, anger, wrath,
tribulation, and distress, on every soul of man that worketh
evil; on the Jew first, and on the Greek: but glory, and
honour, and peace to every one that worketh good; to the
Jew first, and to the Greek.”<a id='r408'></a><a href='#f408' class='c007'><sup>[408]</sup></a> There are, indeed, innumerable
passages in the Scriptures which establish with exceeding
clearness the existence of freedom of will.</p>

  <h4 class='c009'>FROM THE LATIN.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c005'>7. But, seeing there are found in the sacred Scriptures
themselves certain expressions occurring in such a connection,
that the opposite of this may appear capable of being
understood from them, let us bring them forth before us,
and, discussing them according to the rule of piety,<a id='r409'></a><a href='#f409' class='c007'><sup>[409]</sup></a> let us
furnish an explanation of them, in order that from those few
passages which we now expound, the solution of those others
which resemble them, and by which any power over the will
seems to be excluded, may become clear. Those expressions,
accordingly, make an impression on very many, which are
used by God in speaking of Pharaoh, as when He frequently
says, “I will harden Pharaoh’s heart.”<a id='r410'></a><a href='#f410' class='c007'><sup>[410]</sup></a> For if he is
hardened by God, and commits sin in consequence of being
so hardened, the cause of his sin is not himself. And if so,
it will appear that Pharaoh does not possess freedom of will;
and it will be maintained, as a consequence, that, agreeably
to this illustration, neither do others who perish owe the
cause of their destruction to the freedom of their own will.
That expression, also, in Ezekiel, when he says, “I will take
away their stony hearts, and will give them hearts of flesh,
that they may walk in my precepts, and keep my ways,”<a id='r411'></a><a href='#f411' class='c007'><sup>[411]</sup></a>
may impress some, inasmuch as it seems to be a gift of God,
either to walk in His ways or to keep His precepts,<a id='r412'></a><a href='#f412' class='c007'><sup>[412]</sup></a> if He
take away that stony heart which is an obstacle to the keeping
of His commandments, and bestow and implant a better
and more impressible heart, which is called now<a id='r413'></a><a href='#f413' class='c007'><sup>[413]</sup></a> a heart of
flesh. Consider also the nature of the answer given in the
Gospel by our Lord and Saviour to those who inquired of
Him why He spoke to the multitude in parables. His words
are: “That seeing they may not see; and hearing they may
hear, and not understand; lest they should be converted, and
their sins be forgiven them.”<a id='r414'></a><a href='#f414' class='c007'><sup>[414]</sup></a> The words, moreover, used
by the Apostle Paul, that “it is not of him that willeth, nor
of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy;”<a id='r415'></a><a href='#f415' class='c007'><sup>[415]</sup></a> in
another passage also, “that to will and to do are of God;”<a id='r416'></a><a href='#f416' class='c007'><sup>[416]</sup></a>
and again, elsewhere, “Therefore hath He mercy upon
whom He will, and whom He will He hardeneth. Thou
wilt say then unto me, Why doth He yet find fault? For
who shall resist His will? O man, who art thou that repliest
against God? Shall the thing formed say to him who hath
formed it, Why hast thou made me thus? Hath not the
potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one
vessel unto honour, and another to dishonour?”<a id='r417'></a><a href='#f417' class='c007'><sup>[417]</sup></a>—these
and similar declarations seem to have no small influence in
preventing very many from believing that every one is to
be considered as having freedom over his own will, and in
making it appear to be a consequence of the will of God
whether a man is either saved or lost.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>FROM THE GREEK.</h4>
<p class='c005'>7. But since certain declarations of the Old Testament
and of the New lead to the opposite conclusion—namely, that
it does not depend on ourselves to keep the commandments
and to be saved, or to transgress them and to be lost—let us
adduce them one by one, and see the explanations of them,
in order that from those which we adduce, any one selecting
in a similar way all the passages that seem to nullify free-will,
may consider what is said about them by way of explanation.
And now, the statements regarding Pharaoh have
troubled many, respecting whom God declared several times,
“I will harden Pharaoh’s heart.”<a id='r418'></a><a href='#f418' class='c007'><sup>[418]</sup></a> For if he is hardened by
God, and commits sin in consequence of being hardened, he
is not the cause of sin to himself; and if so, then neither
does Pharaoh possess free-will. And some one will say that,
in a similar way, they who perish have not free-will, and will
not perish of themselves. The declaration also in Ezekiel,
“I will take away their stony hearts, and will put in them
hearts of flesh, that they may walk in my precepts, and keep
my commandments,”<a id='r419'></a><a href='#f419' class='c007'><sup>[419]</sup></a> might lead one to think that it was
God who gave the power to walk in His commandments, and
to keep His precepts, by His withdrawing the hindrance—the
stony heart, and implanting a better—a heart of flesh. And
let us look also at the passage in the Gospel—the answer
which the Saviour returns to those who inquired why He
spake to the multitude in parables. His words are: “That
seeing they might not see; and hearing they may hear, and
not understand; lest they should be converted, and their sins
be forgiven them.”<a id='r420'></a><a href='#f420' class='c007'><sup>[420]</sup></a> The passage also in Paul: “It is not
of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God
that showeth mercy.”<a id='r421'></a><a href='#f421' class='c007'><sup>[421]</sup></a> The declarations, too, in other places,
that “both to will and to do are of God;”<a id='r422'></a><a href='#f422' class='c007'><sup>[422]</sup></a> “that God hath
mercy upon whom He will have mercy, and whom He will
He hardeneth. Thou wilt say then, Why doth He yet find
fault? For who hath resisted His will?” ”The persuasion
is of Him that calleth, and not of us.”<a id='r423'></a><a href='#f423' class='c007'><sup>[423]</sup></a> “Nay, O man, who
art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed
say to him that hath formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?
Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump
to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?”<a id='r424'></a><a href='#f424' class='c007'><sup>[424]</sup></a>
Now these passages are sufficient of themselves to trouble the
multitude, as if man were not possessed of free-will, but as if
it were God who saves and destroys whom He will.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>FROM THE LATIN.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c005'>8. Let us begin, then, with those words which were spoken
to Pharaoh, who is said to have been hardened by God, in
order that he might not let the people go; and, along with
his case, the language of the apostle also will be considered,
where he says, “Therefore He hath mercy on whom He will,
and whom He will He hardeneth.”<a id='r425'></a><a href='#f425' class='c007'><sup>[425]</sup></a> For it is on these
passages chiefly that the heretics rely, asserting that salvation
is not in our own power, but that souls are of such a
nature as must by all means be either lost or saved; and
that in no way can a soul which is of an evil nature become
good, or one which is of a virtuous nature be made bad. And
hence they maintain that Pharaoh, too, being of a ruined
nature, was on that account hardened by God, who hardens
those that are of an earthly nature, but has compassion on
those who are of a spiritual nature. Let us see, then, what
is the meaning of their assertion; and let us, in the first place,
request them to tell us whether they maintain that the soul
of Pharaoh was of an earthly nature, such as they term lost.
They will undoubtedly answer that it was of an earthly
nature. If so, then to believe God, or to obey Him, when
his nature opposed his so doing, was an impossibility. And
if this were his condition by nature, what further need was
there for his heart to be hardened, and this not once, but
several times, unless indeed because it was possible for him
to yield to persuasion? Nor could any one be said to be
hardened by another, save him who of himself was not obdurate.
And if he were not obdurate of himself, it follows
that neither was he of an earthly nature, but such an one as
might give way when overpowered<a id='r426'></a><a href='#f426' class='c007'><sup>[426]</sup></a> by signs and wonders.
But he was necessary for God’s purpose, in order that, for
the saving of the multitude, He might manifest in him His
power by his offering resistance to numerous miracles, and
struggling against the will of God, and his heart being by
this means said to be hardened. Such are our answers, in
the first place, to these persons; and by these their assertion
may be overturned, according to which they think that
Pharaoh was destroyed in consequence of his evil nature.<a id='r427'></a><a href='#f427' class='c007'><sup>[427]</sup></a>
And with regard to the language of the Apostle Paul, we
must answer them in a similar way. For who are they
whom God hardens, according to your view? Those, namely,
whom you term of a ruined nature, and who, I am to suppose,
would have done something else had they not been
hardened. If, indeed, they come to destruction in consequence
of being hardened, they no longer perish naturally,
but in virtue of what befalls them. Then, in the next place,
upon whom does God show mercy? On those, namely,
who are to be saved. And in what respect do those persons
stand in need of a second compassion, who are to be saved
once by their nature, and so come naturally to blessedness,
except that it is shown even from their case, that, because it
was possible for them to perish, they therefore obtain mercy,
that so they may not perish, but come to salvation, and
possess the kingdom of the good. And let this be our answer
to those who devise and invent the fable<a id='r428'></a><a href='#f428' class='c007'><sup>[428]</sup></a> of good or bad
natures, <i>i.e.</i> of earthly or spiritual souls, in consequence of
which, as they say, each one is either saved or lost.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>FROM THE GREEK.</h4>
<p class='c005'>8. Let us begin, then, with what is said about Pharaoh—that
he was hardened by God, that he might not send away
the people; along with which will be examined also the statement
of the apostle, “Therefore hath He mercy on whom He
will have mercy, and whom He will He hardeneth.”<a id='r429'></a><a href='#f429' class='c007'><sup>[429]</sup></a> And
certain of those who hold different opinions misuse these passages,
themselves also almost destroying free-will by introducing
ruined natures incapable of salvation, and others saved
which it is impossible can be lost; and Pharaoh, they say, as
being of a ruined nature, is therefore hardened by God, who
has mercy upon the spiritual, but hardens the earthly. Let us
see now what they mean. For we shall ask them if Pharaoh
was of an earthy nature; and when they answer, we shall
say that he who is of an earthy nature is altogether disobedient
to God: but if disobedient, what need is there of
his heart being hardened, and that not once, but frequently?
Unless perhaps, since it was possible for him to obey (in
which case he would certainly have obeyed, as not being
earthy, when hard pressed by the signs and wonders), God
needs him to be disobedient to a greater degree,<a id='r430'></a><a href='#f430' class='c007'><sup>[430]</sup></a> in order
that He may manifest His mighty deeds for the salvation of
the multitude, and therefore hardens his heart. This will be
our answer to them in the first place, in order to overturn
their supposition that Pharaoh was of a ruined nature. And
the same reply must be given to them with respect to the
statement of the apostle. For whom does God harden?
Those who perish, as if they would obey unless they were
hardened, or manifestly those who would be saved because
they are not of a ruined nature. And on whom has He
mercy? Is it on those who are to be saved? And how
is there need of a second mercy for those who have been
prepared once for salvation, and who will by all means become
blessed on account of their nature? Unless perhaps,
since they are capable of incurring destruction, if they did
not receive mercy, they will obtain mercy, in order that they
may not incur that destruction of which they are capable,
but may be in the condition of those who are saved. And
this is our answer to such persons.</p>

<p class='c005'>9. And now we must return an answer also to those who
would have the God of the law to be just only, and not also
good; and let us ask such in what manner they consider the
heart of Pharaoh to have been hardened by God—by what
acts or by what prospective arrangements.<a id='r431'></a><a href='#f431' class='c007'><sup>[431]</sup></a> For we must
observe the conception of a God<a id='r432'></a><a href='#f432' class='c007'><sup>[432]</sup></a> who in our opinion is both
just and good, but according to them only just. And let
them show us how a God whom they also acknowledge to be
just, can with justice cause the heart of a man to be hardened,
that, in consequence of that very hardening, he may
sin and be ruined. And how shall the justice of God be defended,
if He Himself is the cause of the destruction of those
whom, owing to their unbelief (through their being hardened),
He has afterwards condemned by the authority of a judge?
For why does He blame him, saying, “But since thou wilt
not let my people go, lo, I will smite all the first-born in
Egypt, even thy first-born,”<a id='r433'></a><a href='#f433' class='c007'><sup>[433]</sup></a> and whatever else was spoken
through Moses by God to Pharaoh? For it behoves every
one who maintains the truth of what is recorded in Scripture,
and who desires to show that the God of the law and the
prophets is just, to render a reason for all these things, and
to show how there is in them nothing at all derogatory to
the justice of God, since, although they deny His goodness,
they admit that He is a just judge, and creator of the world.
Different, however, is the method of our reply to those who
assert that the creator of this world is a malignant being, <i>i.e.</i>
a devil.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>FROM THE GREEK.</h4>
<p class='c005'>9. But to those who think they understand the term
“hardened,” we must address the inquiry, What do they
mean by saying that God, by His working, hardens the
heart, and with what purpose does He do this? For let them
observe the conception<a id='r434'></a><a href='#f434' class='c007'><sup>[434]</sup></a> of a God who is in reality just and
good; but if they will not allow this, let it be conceded to
them for the present that He is just; and let them show how
the good and just God, or the just God only, appears to be
just, in hardening the heart of him who perishes because of
his being hardened: and how the just God becomes the
cause of destruction and disobedience, when men are chastened
by Him on account of their hardness and disobedience.
And why does He find fault with him, saying, “Thou
wilt not let my people go;”<a id='r435'></a><a href='#f435' class='c007'><sup>[435]</sup></a>  “Lo, I will smite all the first-born
in Egypt, even thy first-born;”<a id='r436'></a><a href='#f436' class='c007'><sup>[436]</sup></a> and whatever else is
recorded as spoken from God to Pharaoh through the intervention
of Moses? For he who believes that the Scriptures
are true, and that God is just, must necessarily endeavour,
if he be honest,<a id='r437'></a><a href='#f437' class='c007'><sup>[437]</sup></a> to show how God, in using such expressions,
may be distinctly<a id='r438'></a><a href='#f438' class='c007'><sup>[438]</sup></a> understood to be just. But if any
one should stand, declaring with uncovered head that the
Creator of the world was inclined to wickedness,<a id='r439'></a><a href='#f439' class='c007'><sup>[439]</sup></a> we should
need other words to answer them.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>

</div>
<p class='c005'>10. But since we acknowledge the God who spoke by
Moses to be not only just, but also good, let us carefully inquire
how it is in keeping with the character of a just and good
Deity to have hardened the heart of Pharaoh. And let us see
whether, following the example of the Apostle Paul, we are
able to solve the difficulty by help of some parallel instances:
if we can show, <i>e.g.</i>, that by one and the same act God has
pity upon one individual, but hardens another; not purposing
or desiring that he who is hardened should be so, but because,
in the manifestation of His goodness and patience, the heart
of those who treat His kindness and forbearance with contempt
and insolence is hardened by the punishment of their crimes
being delayed; while those, on the other hand, who make His
goodness and patience the occasion of their repentance and
reformation, obtain compassion. To show more clearly, however,
what we mean, let us take the illustration employed by
the Apostle Paul in the Epistle to the Hebrews, where he
says, “For the earth, which drinketh in the rain that cometh
oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom
it is dressed, will receive blessing from God; but that which
beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing,
whose end is to be burned.”<a id='r440'></a><a href='#f440' class='c007'><sup>[440]</sup></a> Now from those words of
Paul which we have quoted, it is clearly shown that by one
and the same act on the part of God—that, viz. by which He
sends rain upon the earth—one portion of the ground, when
carefully cultivated, brings forth good fruits; while another,
neglected and uncared for, produces thorns and thistles.
And if one, speaking as it were in the person of the rain,<a id='r441'></a><a href='#f441' class='c007'><sup>[441]</sup></a>
were to say, “It is I, the rain, that have made the good
fruits, and it is I that have caused the thorns and thistles to
grow,” however hard<a id='r442'></a><a href='#f442' class='c007'><sup>[442]</sup></a> the statement might appear, it would
nevertheless be true; for unless the rain had fallen, neither
fruits, nor thorns, nor thistles would have sprung up, whereas
by the coming of the rain the earth gave birth to both.
Now, although it is due to the beneficial action of the rain
that the earth has produced herbs of both kinds, it is not to
the rain that the diversity of the herbs is properly to be
ascribed; but on those will justly rest the blame for the bad
seed, who, although they might have turned up the ground
by frequent ploughing, and have broken the clods by repeated
harrowing, and have extirpated all useless and noxious
weeds, and have cleared and prepared the fields for the
coming showers by all the labour and toil which cultivation
demands, have nevertheless neglected to do this, and who
will accordingly reap briers and thorns, the most appropriate
fruit of their sloth. And the consequence therefore is, that
while the rain falls in kindness and impartiality<a id='r443'></a><a href='#f443' class='c007'><sup>[443]</sup></a> equally upon
the whole earth, yet, by one and the same operation of the
rain, that soil which is cultivated yields with a blessing useful
fruits to the diligent and careful cultivators, while that which
has become hardened through the neglect of the husbandman
brings forth only thorns and thistles. Let us therefore
view those signs and miracles which were done by God, as
the showers furnished by Him from above; and the purpose
and desires of men, as the cultivated and uncultivated soil,
which is of one and the same nature indeed, as is every soil
compared with another, but not in one and the same state of
cultivation. From which it follows that every one’s will,<a id='r444'></a><a href='#f444' class='c007'><sup>[444]</sup></a>
if untrained, and fierce, and barbarous, is either hardened by
the miracles and wonders of God, growing more savage and
thorny than ever, or it becomes more pliant, and yields itself
up with the whole mind to obedience, if it be cleared from
vice and subjected to training.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>FROM THE GREEK.</h4>
<p class='c005'>10. But since they say that they regard Him as a just
God, and we as one who is at the same time good and just,
let us consider how the good and just God could harden the
heart of Pharaoh. See, then, whether, by an illustration
used by the apostle in the Epistle to the Hebrews, we are
able to prove that by one operation<a id='r445'></a><a href='#f445' class='c007'><sup>[445]</sup></a> God has mercy upon
one man while He hardens another, although not intending to
harden; but, [although] having a good purpose, hardening
follows as a result of the inherent principle of wickedness
in such persons,<a id='r446'></a><a href='#f446' class='c007'><sup>[446]</sup></a> and so He is said to harden him who is
hardened. “The earth,” he says, “which drinketh in the rain
that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for
them for whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God;
but that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is
nigh to cursing, whose end is to be burned.”<a id='r447'></a><a href='#f447' class='c007'><sup>[447]</sup></a> As respects
the rain, then, there is one operation; and there being one
operation as regards the rain, the ground which is cultivated
produces fruit, while that which is neglected and is barren
produces thorns. Now, it might seem profane<a id='r448'></a><a href='#f448' class='c007'><sup>[448]</sup></a> for Him
who rains to say, “I produced the fruits, and the thorns that
are in the earth;” and yet, although profane, it is true.
For, had rain not fallen, there would have been neither fruits
nor thorns; but, having fallen at the proper time and in
moderation, both were produced. The ground, now, which
drank in the rain which often fell upon it, and yet produced
thorns and briers, is rejected and nigh to cursing. The blessing,
then, of the rain descended even upon the inferior land;
but it, being neglected and uncultivated, yielded thorns and
thistles. In the same way, therefore, the wonderful works
also done by God are, as it were, the rain; while the differing
purposes are, as it were, the cultivated and neglected land,
being [yet], like earth, of one nature.</p>

</div>
<p class='c005'>11. But, to establish the point more clearly, it will not be
superfluous to employ another illustration, as if, <i>e.g.</i>, one were
to say that it is the sun which hardens and liquefies, although
liquefying and hardening are things of an opposite nature.
Now it is not incorrect to say that the sun, by one and the
same power of its heat, melts wax indeed, but dries up and
hardens mud:<a id='r449'></a><a href='#f449' class='c007'><sup>[449]</sup></a> not that its power operates one way upon mud,
and in another way upon wax; but that the qualities of mud
and wax are different, although according to nature they are
one thing,<a id='r450'></a><a href='#f450' class='c007'><sup>[450]</sup></a> both being from the earth. In this way, then,
one and the same working upon the part of God, which was
administered by Moses in signs and wonders, made manifest
the hardness of Pharaoh, which he had conceived in
the intensity of his wickedness<a id='r451'></a><a href='#f451' class='c007'><sup>[451]</sup></a>, but exhibited the obedience
of those other Egyptians who were intermingled with the
Israelites, and who are recorded to have quitted Egypt at
the same time with the Hebrews. With respect to the statement
that the heart of Pharaoh was subdued by degrees, so
that on one occasion he said, “Go not far away; ye shall go
a three days’ journey, but leave your wives, and your children,
and your cattle,”<a id='r452'></a><a href='#f452' class='c007'><sup>[452]</sup></a> and as regards any other statements,
according to which he appears to yield gradually to the signs
and wonders, what else is shown, save that the power of the
signs and miracles was making some impression on him, but
not so much as it ought to have done? For if the hardening
were of such a nature as many take it to be, he would
not indeed have given way even in a few instances. But
I think there is no absurdity in explaining the tropical or
figurative<a id='r453'></a><a href='#f453' class='c007'><sup>[453]</sup></a> nature of that language employed in speaking of
“hardening,” according to common usage. For those masters
who are remarkable for kindness to their slaves, are frequently
accustomed to say to the latter, when, through much
patience and indulgence on their part, they have become
insolent and worthless: “It is I that have made you what
you are; I have spoiled you; it is my endurance that has
made you good for nothing: I am to blame for your perverse
and wicked habits, because I do not have you immediately
punished for every delinquency according to your
deserts.” For we must first attend to the tropical or
figurative meaning of the language, and so come to see the
force of the expression, and not find fault with the word,
whose inner meaning we do not ascertain. Finally, the
Apostle Paul, evidently treating of such, says to him who
remained in his sins: “Despisest thou the riches of His
goodness, and forbearance, and long-suffering; not knowing
that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance? but,
after thy hardness and impenitent heart, treasurest up unto
thyself wrath on the day of wrath and revelation of the
righteous judgment of God.”<a id='r454'></a><a href='#f454' class='c007'><sup>[454]</sup></a> Such are the words of the
apostle to him who is in his sins. Let us apply these very
expressions to Pharaoh, and see if they also are not spoken of
him with propriety, since, according to his hardness and impenitent
heart, he treasured and stored up for himself wrath
on the day of wrath, inasmuch as his hardness could never
have been declared and manifested, unless signs and wonders
of such number and magnificence had been performed.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>FROM THE GREEK.</h4>
<p class='c005'>11. And as if the sun, uttering a voice, were to say, “I
liquefy and dry up,” liquefaction and drying up being opposite
things, he would not speak falsely as regards the point
in question;<a id='r455'></a><a href='#f455' class='c007'><sup>[455]</sup></a> wax being melted and mud being dried by
the same heat; so the same operation, which was performed
through the instrumentality of Moses, proved the hardness of
Pharaoh on the one hand, the result of his wickedness, and
the yielding of the mixed Egyptian multitude who took their
departure with the Hebrews. And the brief statement<a id='r456'></a><a href='#f456' class='c007'><sup>[456]</sup></a> that
the heart of Pharaoh was softened, as it were, when he said,
“But ye shall not go far: ye will go a three days’ journey,
and leave your wives,”<a id='r457'></a><a href='#f457' class='c007'><sup>[457]</sup></a> and anything else which he said,
yielding little by little before the signs, proves that the
wonders made some impression even upon him, but did not
accomplish all [that they might]. Yet even this would not
have happened, if that which is supposed by the many—the
hardening of Pharaoh’s heart—had been produced by God
Himself. And it is not absurd to soften down such expressions
agreeably to common usage:<a id='r458'></a><a href='#f458' class='c007'><sup>[458]</sup></a> for good masters often
say to their slaves, when spoiled by their kindness and forbearance,
“I have made you bad, and I am to blame for
offences of such enormity.” For we must attend to the
character and force of the phrase, and not argue sophistically,<a id='r459'></a><a href='#f459' class='c007'><sup>[459]</sup></a>
disregarding the meaning of the expression. Paul accordingly,
having examined these points clearly, says to the sinner: “Or
despisest thou the riches of His goodness, and forbearance, and
long-suffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth
thee to repentance? but, after thy hardness and impenitent
heart, treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of
wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God.”<a id='r460'></a><a href='#f460' class='c007'><sup>[460]</sup></a>
Now, let what the apostle says to the sinner be addressed to
Pharaoh, and then the announcements made to him will be
understood to have been made with peculiar fitness, as to
one who, according to his hardness and unrepentant heart,
was treasuring up to himself wrath; seeing that his hardness
would not have been proved nor made manifest unless
miracles had been performed, and miracles, too, of such
magnitude and importance.</p>

<p class='c005'>12. But if the proofs which we have adduced do not appear
full enough, and the similitude of the apostle seem wanting
in applicability,<a id='r461'></a><a href='#f461' class='c007'><sup>[461]</sup></a> let us add the voice of prophetic authority,
and see what the prophets declare regarding those who at
first, indeed, leading a righteous life, have deserved to receive
numerous proofs of the goodness of God, but afterwards,
as being human beings, have fallen astray, with whom the
prophet, making himself also one, says: “Why, O Lord,
hast Thou made us to err from Thy way? and hardened our
heart, that we should not fear Thy name? Return, for Thy
servants’ sake, for the tribes of Thine inheritance, that we
also for a little may obtain some inheritance from Thy holy
hill.”<a id='r462'></a><a href='#f462' class='c007'><sup>[462]</sup></a> Jeremiah also employs similar language: “O Lord,
Thou hast deceived us, and we were deceived; Thou hast
held [us], and Thou hast prevailed.”<a id='r463'></a><a href='#f463' class='c007'><sup>[463]</sup></a> The expression, then,
“Why, O Lord, hast Thou hardened our heart, that we
should not fear Thy name?” used by those who prayed for
mercy, is to be taken in a figurative, moral acceptation,<a id='r464'></a><a href='#f464' class='c007'><sup>[464]</sup></a> as
if one were to say, “Why hast Thou spared us so long, and
didst not requite us when we sinned, but didst abandon us,
that so our wickedness might increase, and our liberty of
sinning be extended when punishment ceased?” In like
manner, unless a horse continually feel the spur<a id='r465'></a><a href='#f465' class='c007'><sup>[465]</sup></a> of his
rider, and have his mouth abraded by a bit,<a id='r466'></a><a href='#f466' class='c007'><sup>[466]</sup></a> he becomes
hardened. And a boy also, unless constantly disciplined by
chastisement, will grow up to be an insolent youth, and one
ready to fall headlong into vice. God accordingly abandons
and neglects those whom He has judged undeserving of
chastisement: “For whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth,
and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth.”<a id='r467'></a><a href='#f467' class='c007'><sup>[467]</sup></a> From which
we are to suppose that those are to be received into the rank
and affection of sons, who have deserved to be scourged and
chastened by the Lord, in order that they also, through
endurance of trials and tribulations, may be able to say,
“Who shall separate us from the love of God which is
in Christ Jesus? shall tribulation, or anguish, or famine,
or nakedness, or peril, or sword?”<a id='r468'></a><a href='#f468' class='c007'><sup>[468]</sup></a> For by all these is each
one’s resolution manifested and displayed, and the firmness
of his perseverance made known, not so much to God, who
knows all things before they happen, as to the rational and
heavenly virtues,<a id='r469'></a><a href='#f469' class='c007'><sup>[469]</sup></a> who have obtained a part in the work of
procuring human salvation, as being a sort of assistants and
ministers to God. Those, on the other hand, who do not yet
offer themselves to God with such constancy and affection,
and are not ready to come into His service, and to prepare
their souls for trial, are said to be abandoned by God, <i>i.e.</i> not
to be instructed, inasmuch as they are not prepared for instruction,
their training or care being undoubtedly postponed
to a later time. These certainly do not know what they will
obtain from God, unless they first entertain the desire of
being benefited; and this finally will be the case, if a man
come first to a knowledge of himself, and feel what are his
defects, and understand from whom he either ought or can
seek the supply of his deficiencies. For he who does not
know beforehand of his weakness or his sickness, cannot seek
a physician; or at least, after recovering his health, that man
will not be grateful to his physician who did not first recognise
the dangerous nature of his ailment. And so, unless a
man has first ascertained the defects of his life, and the evil
nature of his sins, and made this known by confession from
his own lips, he cannot be cleansed or acquitted, lest he should
be ignorant that what he possesses has been bestowed on him
by favour, but should consider as his own property what flows
from the divine liberality, which idea undoubtedly generates
arrogance of mind and pride, and finally becomes the cause
of the individual’s ruin. And this, we must believe, was the
case with the devil, who viewed as his own, and not as given
him by God, the primacy<a id='r470'></a><a href='#f470' class='c007'><sup>[470]</sup></a> which he held at the time when
he was unstained;<a id='r471'></a><a href='#f471' class='c007'><sup>[471]</sup></a> and thus was fulfilled in him the declaration,
that “every one who exalteth himself shall be abased.”<a id='r472'></a><a href='#f472' class='c007'><sup>[472]</sup></a>
From which it appears to me that the divine mysteries were
concealed from the wise and prudent, according to the statement
of Scripture, that “no flesh should glory before God,”<a id='r473'></a><a href='#f473' class='c007'><sup>[473]</sup></a>
and revealed to children—to those, namely, who, after they
have become infants and little children, <i>i.e.</i> have returned to
the humility and simplicity of children, then make progress;
and on arriving at perfection, remember that they have obtained
their state of happiness, not by their own merits, but
by the grace and compassion of God.</p>

<p class='c005'>12. But since such narratives are slow to secure assent,<a id='r474'></a><a href='#f474' class='c007'><sup>[474]</sup></a> and
are considered to be forced,<a id='r475'></a><a href='#f475' class='c007'><sup>[475]</sup></a> let us see from the prophetical
declarations also, what those persons say, who, although they
have experienced the great kindness of God, have not lived
virtuously, but have afterwards sinned. “Why, O Lord,
hast Thou made us to err from Thy ways? Why hast Thou
hardened our heart, so as not to fear Thy name? Return
for Thy servants’ sake, for the tribes of Thine inheritance,
that we may inherit a small portion of Thy holy mountain.”<a id='r476'></a><a href='#f476' class='c007'><sup>[476]</sup></a>
And in Jeremiah: “Thou hast deceived me, O Lord, and I
was deceived; Thou wert strong, and Thou didst prevail.”<a id='r477'></a><a href='#f477' class='c007'><sup>[477]</sup></a>
For the expression, “Why hast Thou hardened our heart,
so as not to fear Thy name?” uttered by those who are
begging to receive mercy, is in its nature as follows: “Why
hast Thou spared us so long, not visiting us because of our
sins, but deserting us, until our transgressions come to a
height?” Now He leaves the greater part of men unpunished,
both in order that the habits of each one may
be examined, so far as it depends upon ourselves, and that
the virtuous may be made manifest in consequence of the
test applied; while the others, not escaping notice from God—for
He knows all things before they exist—but from the
rational creation and themselves, may afterwards obtain the
means of cure, seeing they would not have known the benefit
had they not condemned themselves. It is of advantage to
each one, that he perceive his own peculiar nature<a id='r478'></a><a href='#f478' class='c007'><sup>[478]</sup></a> and the
grace of God. For he who does not perceive his own weakness
and the divine favour, although he receive a benefit,
yet, not having made trial of himself, nor having condemned
himself, will imagine that the benefit conferred upon him
by the grace of Heaven is his own doing. And this imagination,
producing also vanity,<a id='r479'></a><a href='#f479' class='c007'><sup>[479]</sup></a> will be the cause of a downfall:
which, we conceive, was the case with the devil, who
attributed to himself the priority which he possessed when in
a state of sinlessness.<a id='r480'></a><a href='#f480' class='c007'><sup>[480]</sup></a> “For every one that exalteth himself
shall be abased,” and “every one that humbleth himself
shall be exalted.”<a id='r481'></a><a href='#f481' class='c007'><sup>[481]</sup></a> And observe, that for this reason divine
things have been concealed from the wise and prudent, in
order, as says the apostle, that “no flesh should glory in the

those who after childhood have come to better things, and
who remember that it is not so much from their own effort,
as by the unspeakable goodness [of God], that they have
reached the greatest possible extent of blessedness.</p>

<p class='c005'>13. It is therefore by the sentence of God that he is abandoned
who deserves to be so, while over some sinners God
exercises forbearance; not, however, without a definite principle
of action.<a id='r483'></a><a href='#f483' class='c007'><sup>[483]</sup></a> Nay, the very fact that He is long-suffering
conduces to the advantage of those very persons, since the
soul over which He exercises this providential care is immortal;
and, as being immortal and everlasting, it is not,
although not immediately cared for, excluded from salvation,
which is postponed to a more convenient time. For perhaps
it is expedient for those who have been more deeply imbued
with the poison of wickedness to obtain this salvation at a
later period. For as medical men sometimes, although they
could quickly cover over the scars of wounds, keep back and
delay the cure for the present, in the expectation of a better
and more perfect recovery, knowing that it is more salutary
to retard the treatment in the cases of swellings caused by
wounds, and to allow the malignant humours to flow off for
a while, rather than to hasten a superficial cure, by shutting
up in the veins the poison of a morbid humour, which, excluded
from its customary outlets, will undoubtedly creep
into the inner parts of the limbs, and penetrate to the very
vitals of the viscera, producing no longer mere disease in the
body, but causing destruction to life; so, in like manner,
God also, who knows the secret things of the heart, and foreknows
the future, in much forbearance allows certain events
to happen, which, coming from without upon men, cause to
come forth into the light the passions and vices which are
concealed within, that by their means those may be cleansed
and cured who, through great negligence and carelessness,
have admitted within themselves the roots and seeds of sins,
so that, when driven outwards and brought to the surface,
they may in a certain degree be cast forth and dispersed.<a id='r484'></a><a href='#f484' class='c007'><sup>[484]</sup></a>
And thus, although a man may appear to be afflicted with evils
of a serious kind, suffering convulsions in all his limbs, he
may nevertheless, at some future time, obtain relief and a
cessation from his trouble; and, after enduring his afflictions
to satiety, may, after many sufferings, be restored again to
his [proper] condition. For God deals with souls not merely
with a view to the short space of our present life, included
within sixty years<a id='r485'></a><a href='#f485' class='c007'><sup>[485]</sup></a> or more, but with reference to a perpetual
and never-ending period, exercising His providential care
over souls that are immortal, even as He Himself is eternal
and immortal. For He made the rational nature, which He
formed in His own image and likeness, incorruptible; and
therefore the soul, which is immortal, is not excluded by the
shortness of the present life from the divine remedies and
cures.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>FROM THE GREEK.</h4>
<p class='c005'>13. It is not without reason, then, that he who is abandoned,
is abandoned to the divine judgment, and that God
is long-suffering with certain sinners; but because it will
be for their advantage, with respect to the immortality of
the soul and the unending world,<a id='r486'></a><a href='#f486' class='c007'><sup>[486]</sup></a> that they be not quickly
brought<a id='r487'></a><a href='#f487' class='c007'><sup>[487]</sup></a> into a state of salvation, but be conducted to it
more slowly, after having experienced many evils. For as
physicians, who are able to cure a man quickly, when they
suspect that a hidden poison exists in the body, do the reverse
of healing, making this more certain through their very desire
to heal, deeming it better for a considerable time to retain the
patient under inflammation and sickness, in order that he may
recover his health more surely, than to appear to produce a
rapid recovery, and afterwards to cause a relapse, and [thus]
that hasty cure last only for a time; in the same way, God
also, who knows the secret things of the heart, and foresees
future events, in His long-suffering, permits [certain events
to occur], and by means of those things which happen from
without extracts the secret evil, in order to cleanse him who
through carelessness has received the seeds of sin, that having
vomited them forth when they come to the surface, although
he may have been deeply involved in evils, he may afterwards
obtain healing after his wickedness, and be renewed.<a id='r488'></a><a href='#f488' class='c007'><sup>[488]</sup></a> For
God governs souls not with reference, let me say, to the fifty<a id='r489'></a><a href='#f489' class='c007'><sup>[489]</sup></a>
years of the present life, but with reference to an illimitable<a id='r490'></a><a href='#f490' class='c007'><sup>[490]</sup></a>
age: for He made the thinking principle immortal in its
nature, and kindred to Himself; and the rational soul is not,
as in this life, excluded from cure.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>FROM THE LATIN.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c005'>14. But let us take from the Gospels also the similitudes
of those things which we have mentioned, in which is described
a certain rock, having on it a little superficial earth,
on which, when a seed falls, it is said quickly to spring up;
but when sprung up, it withers as the sun ascends in the
heavens, and dies away, because it did not cast its root deeply
into the ground.<a id='r491'></a><a href='#f491' class='c007'><sup>[491]</sup></a> Now this rock undoubtedly represents the
human soul, hardened on account of its own negligence, and
converted into stone because of its wickedness. For God
gave no one a stony heart by a creative act; but each individual’s
heart is said to become stony through his own
wickedness and disobedience. As, therefore, if one were to
blame a husbandman for not casting his seed more quickly
upon rocky ground, because seed cast upon other rocky soil
was seen to spring up speedily, the husbandman would certainly
say in reply: “I sow this soil more slowly, for this
reason, that it may retain the seed which it has received; for
it suits this ground to be sown somewhat slowly, lest perhaps
the crop, having sprouted too rapidly, and coming forth from
the mere surface of a shallow soil, should be unable to withstand
the rays of the sun.” Would not he who formerly
found fault acquiesce in the reasons and superior knowledge
of the husbandman, and approve as done on rational grounds
what formerly appeared to him as founded on no reason?
And in the same way, God, the thoroughly skilled husbandman
of all His creation, undoubtedly conceals and delays to
another time those<a id='r492'></a><a href='#f492' class='c007'><sup>[492]</sup></a> things which we think ought to have
obtained health sooner, in order that not the outside of
things, rather than the inside, may be cured. But if any one
now were to object to us that certain seeds do even fall upon
rocky ground, <i>i.e.</i> on a hard and stony heart, we should
answer that even this does not happen without the arrangement
of Divine Providence; inasmuch as, but for this, it
would not be known what condemnation was incurred by
rashness in hearing and indifference in investigation,<a id='r493'></a><a href='#f493' class='c007'><sup>[493]</sup></a> nor,
certainly, what benefit was derived from being trained in an
orderly manner. And hence it happens that the soul comes
to know its defects, and to cast the blame upon itself, and,
consistently with this, to reserve and submit itself to training,
<i>i.e.</i> in order that it may see that its faults must first be
removed, and that then it must come to receive the instruction
of wisdom. As, therefore, souls are innumerable, so
also are their manners, and purposes, and movements, and
appetencies, and incitements different, the variety of which
can by no means be grasped by the human mind; and therefore
to God alone must be left the art, and the knowledge,
and the power of an arrangement of this kind, as He alone
can know both the remedies for each individual soul, and
measure out the time of its cure. It is He alone then who,
as we said, recognises the ways of individual men, and determines
by what way He ought to lead Pharaoh, that through
him His name might be named in all the earth, having previously
chastised him by many blows, and finally drowning
him in the sea. By this drowning, however, it is not to be
supposed that God’s providence as regards Pharaoh was terminated;
for we must not imagine, because he was drowned,
that therefore he had forthwith completely<a id='r494'></a><a href='#f494' class='c007'><sup>[494]</sup></a> perished: “for in
the hand of God are both we and our words; all wisdom,
also, and knowledge of workmanship,”<a id='r495'></a><a href='#f495' class='c007'><sup>[495]</sup></a> as Scripture declares.
But these points we have discussed according to our ability,
treating of that chapter<a id='r496'></a><a href='#f496' class='c007'><sup>[496]</sup></a> of Scripture in which it is said that
God hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and agreeably to the
statement, “He hath mercy on whom He will have mercy,
and whom He will He hardeneth.”<a id='r497'></a><a href='#f497' class='c007'><sup>[497]</sup></a></p>
<h4 class='c009'>FROM THE GREEK.</h4>
<p class='c005'>14. Come now, and let us use the following image<a id='r498'></a><a href='#f498' class='c007'><sup>[498]</sup></a> from
the Gospel. There is a certain rock, with a little surface-soil,
on which, if seeds fall, they quickly spring up; but when
sprung up, as not having root, they are burned and withered
when the sun has arisen. Now this rock is a human soul,
hardened on account of its negligence, and converted to stone
because of its wickedness; for no one receives from God a
heart created of stone, but it becomes such in consequence of
wickedness. If one, then, were to find fault with the husbandman
for not sowing his seed sooner upon the rocky soil,
when he saw other rocky ground which had received seed
flourishing, the husbandman would reply, “I shall sow this
ground more slowly, casting in seeds that will be able to
retain their hold, this slower method being better for the
ground, and more secure than that which receives the seed
in a more rapid manner, and more upon the surface.” [The
person finding fault] would yield his assent to the husbandman,
as one who spoke with sound reason, and who acted
with skill: so also the great Husbandman of all nature postpones
that benefit which might be deemed premature,<a id='r499'></a><a href='#f499' class='c007'><sup>[499]</sup></a> that
it may not prove superficial. But it is probable that here
some one may object to us with reference to this: “Why
do some of the seeds fall upon the earth that has superficial
soil, the soul being, as it were, a rock?” Now we must say,
in answer to this, that it was better for this soul, which desired
better things precipitately,<a id='r500'></a><a href='#f500' class='c007'><sup>[500]</sup></a> and not by a way which led
to them, to obtain its desire, in order that, condemning itself
on this account, it may, after a long time, endure to receive
the husbandry which is according to nature. For souls are,
as one may say, innumerable; and their habits are innumerable,
and their movements, and their purposes, and their
assaults, and their efforts, of which there is only one admirable
administrator, who knows both the seasons, and the
fitting helps, and the avenues, and the ways, viz. the God
and Father of all things, who knows how He conducts even
Pharaoh by so great events, and by drowning in the sea, with
which latter occurrence His superintendence of Pharaoh does
not cease. For he was not annihilated when drowned: “For
in the hand of God are both we and our words; all wisdom
also, and knowledge of workmanship.”<a id='r501'></a><a href='#f501' class='c007'><sup>[501]</sup></a> And such is a moderate
defence with regard to the statements that “Pharaoh’s
heart was hardened,” and that “God hath mercy upon whom
He will have mercy, and whom He will He hardeneth.”</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>FROM THE LATIN.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c005'>15. Let us now look at those passages of Ezekiel where
he says, “I will take away from them their stony heart, and
I will put in them a heart of flesh, that they may walk in my
statutes, and keep mine ordinances.”<a id='r502'></a><a href='#f502' class='c007'><sup>[502]</sup></a> For if God, when He
pleases, takes away a heart of stone and bestows a heart of
flesh, that His ordinances may be observed and His commandments
may be obeyed, it will then appear that it is not
in our power to put away wickedness. For the taking away
of a stony heart seems to be nothing else than the removal of
the wickedness by which one is hardened, from whomsoever
God pleases to remove it. Nor is the bestowal of a heart of
flesh, that the precepts of God may be observed and His
commandments obeyed, any other thing than a man becoming
obedient, and no longer resisting the truth, but performing
works of virtue. If, then, God promises to do this, and
if, before He takes away the stony heart, we are unable to
remove it from ourselves, it follows that it is not in our
power, but in God’s only, to cast away wickedness. And
again, if it is not our doing to form within us a heart of flesh,
but the work of God alone, it will not be in our power to live
virtuously, but it will in everything appear to be a work of
divine grace. Such are the assertions of those who wish to
prove from the authority of Holy Scripture that nothing lies
in our own power. Now to these we answer, that these
passages are not to be so understood, but in the following
manner. Take the case of one who was ignorant and untaught,
and who, feeling the disgrace of his ignorance, should,
driven either by an exhortation from some person, or incited
by a desire to emulate other wise men, hand himself over to
one by whom he is assured that he will be carefully trained
and competently instructed. If he, then, who had formerly
hardened himself in ignorance, yield himself, as we have
said, with full purpose of mind to a master, and promise to
obey him in all things, the master, on seeing clearly the
resolute nature of his determination, will appropriately promise
to take away all ignorance, and to implant knowledge
within his mind; not that he undertakes to do this if
the disciple refuse or resist his efforts, but only on his offering
and binding himself to obedience in all things. So also
the word of God promises to those who draw near to Him,
that He will take away their stony heart, not indeed from
those who do not listen to His word, but from those who
receive the precepts of His teaching; as in the Gospels we
find the sick approaching the Saviour, asking to receive
health, and thus at last be cured. And in order that the
blind might be healed and regain their sight, their part consisted
in making supplication to the Saviour, and in believing
that their cure could be effected by Him; while His part,
on the other hand, lay in restoring to them the power of
vision. And in this way also does the Word of God promise
to bestow instruction by taking away the stony heart, <i>i.e.</i> by
the removal of wickedness, that so men may be able to walk
in the divine precepts, and observe the commandments of
the law.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>FROM THE GREEK.</h4>
<p class='c005'>15. Let us look also at the declaration in Ezekiel, which
says, “I shall take away their stony hearts, and will put in
them hearts of flesh, that they may walk in my statutes and
keep my precepts.”<a id='r503'></a><a href='#f503' class='c007'><sup>[503]</sup></a> For if God, when He wills, takes away
the stony hearts, and implants hearts of flesh, so that His
precepts are obeyed and His commandments are observed, it
is not in our power to put away wickedness. For the taking
away of the stony hearts is nothing else than the taking
away of the wickedness, according to which one is hardened,
from him from whom God wills to take it; and the implanting
of a heart of flesh, so that a man may walk in the precepts
of God and keep His commandments, what else is it
than to become somewhat yielding and unresistent to the
truth, and to be capable of practising virtues? And if God
promises to do this, and if, before He takes away the stony
hearts, we do not lay them aside, it is manifest that it does
not depend upon ourselves to put away wickedness; and if
it is not we who do anything towards the production within
us of the heart of flesh, but if it is God’s doing, it will not
be our own act to live agreeably to virtue, but altogether [the
result of] divine grace. Such will be the statements of him
who, from the mere words [of Scripture], annihilates free-will.<a id='r504'></a><a href='#f504' class='c007'><sup>[504]</sup></a>
But we shall answer, saying, that we ought to understand
these passages thus: That as a man, <i>e.g.</i>, who happened
to be ignorant and uneducated, on perceiving his own defects,
either in consequence of an exhortation from his teacher, or
in some other way, should spontaneously give himself up to
him whom he considers able to introduce<a id='r505'></a><a href='#f505' class='c007'><sup>[505]</sup></a> him to education
and virtue; and, on his yielding himself up, his instructor
promises that he will take away his ignorance, and implant
instruction, not as if it contributed nothing to his training,
and to the avoiding of ignorance, that he brought himself to
be healed, but because the instructor promised to improve
him who desired improvement; so, in the same way, the
word of God promises to take away wickedness, which it
calls a stony heart, from those who come to it, not if they
are unwilling, but [only] if they submit themselves to the
Physician of the sick, as in the Gospels the sick are found
coming to the Saviour, and asking to obtain healing, and
so are cured. And, let me say, the recovery of sight by the
blind is, so far as their request goes, the act of those who
believe that they are capable of being healed; but as respects
the restoration of sight, it is the work of our Saviour.
Thus, then, does the word of God promise to implant knowledge
in those who come to it, by taking away the stony
and hard heart, which is wickedness, in order that one may
walk in the divine commandments, and keep the divine
injunctions.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>FROM THE LATIN.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c005'>16. There is next brought before us that declaration
uttered by the Saviour in the Gospel: “That seeing they
may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and
not understand; lest they should happen to be converted, and
their sins be forgiven them.”<a id='r506'></a><a href='#f506' class='c007'><sup>[506]</sup></a> On which our opponent will
remark: “If those who shall hear more distinctly are by all
means to be corrected and converted, and converted in such
a manner as to be worthy of receiving the remission of sins,
and if it be not in their own power to hear the word distinctly,
but if it depend on the Instructor to teach more openly
and distinctly, while he declares that he does not proclaim
to them the word with clearness, lest they should perhaps
hear and understand, and be converted, and be saved, it will
follow, certainly, that their salvation is not dependent upon
themselves. And if this be so, then we have no free-will
either as regards salvation or destruction.” Now were it not
for the words that are added, “Lest perhaps they should be
converted, and their sins be forgiven them,” we might be
more inclined to return the answer, that the Saviour was
unwilling that those individuals whom He foresaw would not
become good, should understand the mysteries of the kingdom
of heaven, and that therefore He spoke to them in parables;
but as that addition follows, “Lest perhaps they should be
converted, and their sins be forgiven them,” the explanation
is rendered more difficult. And, in the first place, we have
to notice what defence this passage furnishes against those
heretics who are accustomed to hunt out of the Old Testament
any expressions which seem, according to their view, to
predicate severity and cruelty of God the Creator, as when
He is described as being affected with the feeling of vengeance
or punishment, or by any of those emotions, however
named, from which they deny the existence of goodness in
the Creator; for they do not judge of the Gospels with the
same mind and feelings, and do not observe whether any such
statements are found in them as they condemn and censure
in the Old Testament. For manifestly, in the passage referred
to, the Saviour is shown, as they themselves admit,
not to speak distinctly, for this very reason, that men may
not be converted, and when converted, receive the remission
of sins. Now, if the words be understood according to the
letter merely, nothing less, certainly, will be contained in
them than in those passages which they find fault with in
the Old Testament. And if they are of opinion that any
expressions occurring in such a connection in the New Testament
stand in need of explanation, it will necessarily follow
that those also occurring in the Old Testament, which are the
subject of censure, may be freed from aspersion by an explanation
of a similar kind, so that by such means the passages
found in both Testaments may be shown to proceed from
one and the same God. But let us return, as we best may,
to the question proposed.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>FROM THE GREEK.</h4>
<p class='c005'>16. There was after this the passage from the Gospel, where
the Saviour said, that for this reason did He speak to those
without in parables, that “seeing they may not see, and hearing
they may not understand; lest they should be converted,
and their sins be forgiven them.”<a id='r507'></a><a href='#f507' class='c007'><sup>[507]</sup></a> Now, our opponent will
say, “If some persons are assuredly converted on hearing
words of greater clearness, so that they become worthy of
the remission of sins, and if it does not depend upon themselves
to hear these words of greater clearness, but upon him
who teaches, and he for this reason does not announce them
to them more distinctly, lest they should see and understand,
it is not within the power of such to be saved; and if so,
we are not possessed of free-will as regards salvation and
destruction.” Effectual, indeed, would be the reply to such
arguments, were it not for the addition, “Lest they should
be converted, and their sins be forgiven them,”—namely, that
the Saviour did not wish those who were not to become good
and virtuous to understand the more mystical [parts of His
teaching], and for this reason spake to them in parables;
but now, on account of the words, “Lest they should be converted,
and their sins be forgiven them,” the defence is more
difficult. In the first place, then, we must notice the passage
in its bearing on the heretics, who hunt out those portions from
the Old Testament where is exhibited, as they themselves
daringly assert, the cruelty<a id='r508'></a><a href='#f508' class='c007'><sup>[508]</sup></a> of the Creator of the world<a id='r509'></a><a href='#f509' class='c007'><sup>[509]</sup></a> in
His purpose of avenging and punishing the wicked,<a id='r510'></a><a href='#f510' class='c007'><sup>[510]</sup></a> or by
whatever other name they wish to designate such a quality,
so speaking only that they may say that goodness does not
exist in the Creator; and who do not deal with the New
Testament in a similar manner, nor in a spirit of candour,<a id='r511'></a><a href='#f511' class='c007'><sup>[511]</sup></a>
but pass by places similar to those which they consider censurable
in the Old Testament. For manifestly, and according
to the Gospel, is the Saviour shown, as they assert, by His
former words, not to speak distinctly for this reason, that men
might not be converted, and, being converted, might become
deserving of the remission of sins: which statement of itself
is nothing inferior<a id='r512'></a><a href='#f512' class='c007'><sup>[512]</sup></a> to those passages from the Old Testament
which are objected to. And if they seek to defend the
Gospel, we must ask them whether they are not acting in a
blameworthy manner in dealing differently with the same
questions; and, while not stumbling against the New Testament,
but seeking to defend it, they nevertheless bring a
charge against the Old regarding similar points, whereas
they ought to offer a defence in the same way of the passages
from the New. And therefore we shall force them, on
account of the resemblances, to regard all as the writings of
one God. Come, then, and let us, to the best of our ability,
furnish an answer to the question submitted to us.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>FROM THE LATIN.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c005'>17. We said formerly, when discussing the case of Pharaoh,
that sometimes it does not lead to good results for a man to
be cured too quickly, especially if the disease, being shut up
within the inner parts of the body, rage with greater fierceness.
Whence God, who is acquainted with secret things, and knows
all things before they happen, in His great goodness delays the
cure of such, and postpones their recovery to a remoter period,
and, so to speak, cures them by not curing them, lest a too
favourable state of health<a id='r513'></a><a href='#f513' class='c007'><sup>[513]</sup></a> should render them incurable. It
is therefore possible that, in the case of those to whom, as being
“without,” the words of our Lord and Saviour were addressed,
He, seeing from His scrutiny of the hearts and reins that
they were not yet able to receive teaching of a clearer type,
veiled by the covering of language the meaning of the profounder
mysteries, lest perhaps, being rapidly converted and
healed, <i>i.e.</i> having quickly obtained the remission of their
sins, they should again easily slide back into the same disease
which they had found could be healed without any difficulty.
For if this be the case, no one can doubt that the punishment
is doubled, and the amount of wickedness increased;
since not only are the sins which had appeared to be forgiven
repeated, but the court<a id='r514'></a><a href='#f514' class='c007'><sup>[514]</sup></a> of virtue also is desecrated
when trodden by deceitful and polluted beings,<a id='r515'></a><a href='#f515' class='c007'><sup>[515]</sup></a> filled within
with hidden wickedness. And what remedy can there ever
be for those who, after eating the impure and filthy food of
wickedness, have tasted the pleasantness of virtue, and received
its sweetness into their mouths, and yet have again
betaken themselves to the deadly and poisonous provision of
sin? And who doubts that it is better for delay and a
temporary abandonment to occur, in order that if, at some
future time, they should happen to be satiated with wickedness,
and the filth with which they are now delighted should
become loathsome, the word of God may at last be appropriately
made clear to them, and that which is holy be not
given to the dogs, nor pearls be cast before swine, which
will trample them under foot, and turn, moreover, and rend
and assault those who have proclaimed to them the word of
God? These, then, are they who are said to be “without,”
undoubtedly by way of contrast with those who are said to
be “within,” and to hear the word of God with greater
clearness. And yet those who are “without” do hear the
word, although it is covered by parables, and overshadowed
by proverbs. There are others, also, besides those who are
without, who are called Tyrians, and who do not hear at all,
respecting whom the Saviour knew that they would have
repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes, if the
miracles performed among others had been done amongst
them, and yet these do not hear those things which are heard
even by those who are “without:” and I believe, for this
reason, that the rank of such in wickedness was far lower
and worse than that of those who are said to be “without,” <i>i.e.</i>
who are not far from those who are within, and who have deserved
to hear the word, although in parables; and because,
perhaps, their cure was delayed to that time when it will be
more tolerable for them on the day of judgment, than for
those before whom those miracles which are recorded were
performed, that so at last, being then relieved from the weight
of their sins, they may enter with more ease and power of
endurance upon the way of safety. And this is a point which
I wish impressed upon those who peruse these pages, that with
respect to topics of such difficulty and obscurity we use our
utmost endeavour, not so much to ascertain clearly the solutions
of the questions (for every one will do this as the Spirit
gives him utterance), as to maintain the rule of faith in the
most unmistakeable manner,<a id='r516'></a><a href='#f516' class='c007'><sup>[516]</sup></a> by striving to show that the
providence of God, which equitably administers all things,
governs also immortal souls on the justest principles, [conferring
rewards] according to the merits and motives of each
individual; the present economy of things<a id='r517'></a><a href='#f517' class='c007'><sup>[517]</sup></a> not being confined
within the life of this world, but the pre-existing state
of merit always furnishing the ground for the state that is to
follow,<a id='r518'></a><a href='#f518' class='c007'><sup>[518]</sup></a> and thus by an eternal and immutable law of equity,
and by the controlling influence of Divine Providence, the immortal
soul is brought to the summit of perfection. If one,
however, were to object to our statement, that the word of
preaching was purposely put aside by certain men of wicked
and worthless character, and [were to inquire] why the word
was preached to those over whom the Tyrians, who were
certainly despised, are preferred in comparison (by which
proceeding, certainly, their wickedness was increased, and
their condemnation rendered more severe, that they should
hear the word who were not to believe it), they must be
answered in the following manner: God, who is the Creator
of the minds of all men, foreseeing complaints against His
providence, especially on the part of those who say, “How
could we believe when we neither beheld those things which
others saw, nor heard those words which were preached to
others? in so far is the blame removed from us, since they to
whom the word was announced, and the signs manifested,
made no delay whatever, but became believers, overpowered
by the very force of the miracles;” wishing to destroy the
grounds for complaints of this kind, and to show that it was
no concealment of Divine Providence, but the determination
of the human mind which was the cause of their ruin, bestowed
the grace of His benefits even upon the unworthy
and the unbelieving, that every mouth might indeed be
shut, and that the mind of man might know that all the
deficiency was on its own part, and none on that of God;
and that it may, at the same time, be understood and recognised
that he receives a heavier sentence of condemnation
who has despised the divine benefits conferred upon him
than he who has not deserved to obtain or hear them, and
that it is a peculiarity of divine compassion, and a mark
of the extreme justice of its administration, that it sometimes
conceals from certain individuals the opportunity of
either seeing or hearing the mysteries of divine power, lest,
after beholding the power of the miracles, and recognising
and hearing the mysteries of its wisdom, they should, on
treating them with contempt and indifference, be punished
with greater severity for their impiety.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>FROM THE GREEK.</h4>
<p class='c005'>17. We asserted also, when investigating the subject of
Pharaoh, that sometimes a rapid cure is not for the advantage
of those who are healed, if, after being seized by troublesome
diseases, they should easily get rid of those by which
they had been entangled. For, despising the evil as one that
is easy of cure, and not being on their guard a second time
against falling into it, they will be involved in it [again].
Wherefore, in the case of such persons, the everlasting God,
the Knower of secrets, who knows all things before they
exist, in conformity with His goodness, delays sending them
more rapid assistance, and, so to speak, in helping them does
not help, the latter course being to their advantage. It is
probable, then, that those “without,” of whom we are speaking,
having been foreseen by the Saviour, according to our
supposition, as not [likely] to prove steady in their conversion,<a id='r519'></a><a href='#f519' class='c007'><sup>[519]</sup></a>
if they should hear more clearly the words that were
spoken, were [so] treated by the Saviour as not to hear distinctly
the deeper [things of His teaching],<a id='r520'></a><a href='#f520' class='c007'><sup>[520]</sup></a> lest, after a rapid
conversion, and after being healed by obtaining remission of
sins, they should despise the wounds of their wickedness, as
being slight and easy of healing, and should again speedily
relapse into them. And perhaps also, suffering punishment
for their former transgressions against virtue, which
they had committed when they had forsaken her, they had
not yet filled up the [full] time; in order that, being abandoned
by the divine superintendence, and being filled<a id='r521'></a><a href='#f521' class='c007'><sup>[521]</sup></a> to
a greater degree by their own evils which they had sown,
they may afterwards be called to a more stable repentance;
so as not to be quickly entangled again in those evils in
which they had formerly been involved when they treated
with insolence the requirements of virtue, and devoted themselves
to worse things. Those, then, who are said to be
“without” (manifestly by comparison with those “within”),
not being very far from those “within,” while those “within”
hear clearly, do themselves hear indistinctly, because they
are addressed in parables; but nevertheless they do hear.
Others, again, of those “without,” who are called Tyrians,
although it was foreknown that they would have repented
long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes, had the Saviour
come near their borders, do not hear even those words which
are heard by those “without” (being, as is probable, very far
inferior in merit to those “without”<a id='r522'></a><a href='#f522' class='c007'><sup>[522]</sup></a>), in order that at another
season, after it has been more tolerable for them than for
those who did not receive the word (among whom he mentioned
also the Tyrians), they may, on hearing the word at
a more appropriate time, obtain a more lasting repentance.
But observe whether, besides our desire to investigate [the
truth], we do not rather strive to maintain an attitude of
piety in everything regarding God and His Christ,<a id='r523'></a><a href='#f523' class='c007'><sup>[523]</sup></a> seeing
we endeavour by every means to prove that, in matters so
great and so peculiar regarding the varied providence of God,
He takes an oversight of the immortal soul. If, indeed, one
were to inquire regarding those things that are objected
to, why those who saw wonders and who heard divine words
are not benefited, while the Tyrians would have repented
if such had been performed and spoken amongst them; and
should ask, and say, Why did the Saviour proclaim such
to these persons, to their own hurt, that their sin might be
reckoned to them as heavier? we must say, in answer to such
an one, that He who understands the dispositions<a id='r524'></a><a href='#f524' class='c007'><sup>[524]</sup></a> of all those
who find fault with His providence—[alleging] that it is
owing to it that they have not believed, because it did not
permit them to see what it enabled others to behold, and did
not arrange for them to hear those words by which others,
on hearing them, were benefited—wishing to prove that their
defence is not founded on reason, He grants those advantages
which those who blame His administration asked; in order
that, after obtaining them, they may notwithstanding be
convicted of the greatest impiety in not having even then
yielded themselves to be benefited, and may cease from such
audacity; and having been made free in respect to this very
point, may learn that God occasionally, in conferring benefits
upon certain persons, delays and procrastinates, not conferring
the favour of seeing and hearing those things which,
when seen and heard, would render the sin of those who did
not believe, after acts so great and peculiar, heavier and more
serious.</p>

<p class='c005'>18. Let us now look to the expression, “It is not of him
that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth
mercy.”<a id='r525'></a><a href='#f525' class='c007'><sup>[525]</sup></a> For our opponents assert, that if it does not depend
upon him that willeth, nor on him that runneth, but on God
that showeth mercy, that a man be saved, our salvation is
not in our own power. For our nature is such as to admit
of our either being saved or not, or else our salvation rests
solely on the will of Him who, if He wills it, shows mercy,
and confers salvation. Now let us inquire, in the first place,
of such persons, whether to desire blessings be a good or evil
act; and whether to hasten after good as a final aim<a id='r526'></a><a href='#f526' class='c007'><sup>[526]</sup></a> be
worthy of praise. If they were to answer that such a procedure
was deserving of censure, they would evidently be
mad; for all holy men both desire blessings and run after
them, and certainly are not blameworthy. How, then, is it
that he who is not saved, if he be of an evil nature, desires
blessings, and runs after them, but does not find them? For
they say that a bad tree does not bring forth good fruits,
whereas it is a good fruit to desire blessings. And how is
the fruit of a bad tree good? And if they assert that to
desire blessings, and to run after them, is an act of indifference,<a id='r527'></a><a href='#f527' class='c007'><sup>[527]</sup></a>
<i>i.e.</i> neither good nor bad, we shall reply, that if it be
an indifferent act to desire blessings, and to run after them,
then the opposite of that will also be an indifferent act, viz.
to desire evils, and to run after them; whereas it is certain that
it is not an indifferent act to desire evils, and to run after
them, but one that is manifestly wicked. It is established,
then, that to desire and follow after blessings is not an
indifferent, but a virtuous proceeding.</p>

<p class='c006'>Having now repelled these objections by the answer
which we have given, let us hasten on to the discussion of
the subject itself, in which it is said, “It is not of him that
willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth
mercy.”<a id='r528'></a><a href='#f528' class='c007'><sup>[528]</sup></a> In the book of Psalms—in the songs of Degrees,
which are ascribed to Solomon—the following statement
occurs: “Except the Lord build the house, they labour in
vain that build it; except the Lord keep the city, the watchman
waketh but in vain.”<a id='r529'></a><a href='#f529' class='c007'><sup>[529]</sup></a> By which words he does not
indeed indicate that we should cease from building or watching
over the safe keeping of that city which is within us; but
what he points out is this, that whatever is built without God,
and whatever is guarded without Him, is built in vain, and
guarded to no purpose. For in all things that are well built
and well protected, the Lord is held to be the cause either
of the building or of its protection. As if, <i>e.g.</i>, we were
to behold some magnificent structure and mass of splendid
building reared with beauteous architectural skill, would we
not justly and deservedly say that such was built not by
human power, but by divine help and might? And yet
from such a statement it will not be meant that the labour
and industry of human effort were inactive, and effected
nothing at all. Or again, if we were to see some city surrounded
by a severe blockade of the enemy, in which threatening
engines were brought against the walls, and the place
hard pressed by a vallum, and weapons, and fire, and all the
instruments of war, by which destruction is prepared, would
we not rightly and deservedly say, if the enemy were repelled
and put to flight, that the deliverance had been wrought for
the liberated city by God? And yet we would not mean, by
so speaking, that either the vigilance of the sentinels, or
the alertness of the young men,<a id='r530'></a><a href='#f530' class='c007'><sup>[530]</sup></a> or the protection of the
guards, had been wanting. And the apostle also must be
understood in a similar manner, because the human will
alone is not sufficient to obtain salvation; nor is any mortal
running able to win the heavenly [rewards], and to obtain
the prize of our high calling<a id='r531'></a><a href='#f531' class='c007'><sup>[531]</sup></a> of God in Christ Jesus, unless
this very good will of ours, and ready purpose, and whatever
that diligence within us may be, be aided or furnished with
divine help. And therefore most logically<a id='r532'></a><a href='#f532' class='c007'><sup>[532]</sup></a> did the apostle
say, that “it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that
runneth, but of God that showeth mercy;” in the same
manner as if we were to say of agriculture what is actually
written: “I planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the
increase. So then neither is he that planteth anything,
neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.”<a id='r533'></a><a href='#f533' class='c007'><sup>[533]</sup></a>
As, therefore, when a field has brought good and rich crops
to perfect maturity, no one would piously and logically assert
that the husbandman had made those fruits, but would
acknowledge that they had been produced by God; so also
is our own perfection brought about, not indeed by our
remaining inactive and idle,<a id='r534'></a><a href='#f534' class='c007'><sup>[534]</sup></a> [but by some activity on our
part]: and yet the consummation of it will not be ascribed
to us, but to God, who is the first and chief cause of the
work. So, when a ship has overcome the dangers of the
sea, although the result be accomplished by great labour on
the part of the sailors, and by the aid of all the art of navigation,
and by the zeal and carefulness of the pilot, and by
the favouring influence of the breezes, and the careful observation
of the signs of the stars, no one in his sound senses
would ascribe the safety of the vessel, when, after being
tossed by the waves, and wearied by the billows, it has at last
reached the harbour in safety, to anything else than to the
mercy of God. Not even the sailors or pilot venture to say,
“I have saved the ship,” but they refer all to the mercy of
God; not that they feel that they have contributed no skill
or labour to save the ship, but because they know that while
they contributed the labour, the safety of the vessel was
ensured by God. So also in the race of our life we ourselves
must expend labour, and bring diligence and zeal to
bear; but it is from God that salvation is to be hoped for as
the fruit of our labour. Otherwise, if God demand none
of our labour, His commandments will appear to be superfluous.
In vain, also, does Paul blame some for having
fallen from the truth, and praise others for abiding in the
faith; and to no purpose does he deliver certain precepts
and institutions to the churches: in vain, also, do we ourselves
either desire or run after what is good. But it is
certain that these things are not done in vain; and it is
certain that neither do the apostles give instructions in vain,
nor the Lord enact laws without a reason. It follows, therefore,
that we declare it to be in vain, rather, for the heretics
to speak evil of these good declarations.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>FROM THE GREEK.</h4>
<p class='c005'>18. Let us look next at the passage: “So, then, it is not
of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that
showeth mercy.”<a id='r535'></a><a href='#f535' class='c007'><sup>[535]</sup></a> For they who find fault say: If “it is not
of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that
showeth mercy,” salvation does not depend upon ourselves,
but upon the arrangement<a id='r536'></a><a href='#f536' class='c007'><sup>[536]</sup></a> made by Him who has formed<a id='r537'></a><a href='#f537' class='c007'><sup>[537]</sup></a>
us such as we are, or on the purpose<a id='r538'></a><a href='#f538' class='c007'><sup>[538]</sup></a> of Him who showeth
mercy when He pleases. Now we must ask these persons
the following questions: Whether to desire what is good is
virtuous or vicious; and whether the desire to run in order
to reach the goal in the pursuit of what is good be worthy of
praise or censure? And if they shall say that it is worthy
of censure, they will return an absurd answer;<a id='r539'></a><a href='#f539' class='c007'><sup>[539]</sup></a> since the
saints desire and run, and manifestly in so acting do nothing
that is blameworthy. But if they shall say that it is virtuous
to desire what is good, and to run after what is good,
we shall ask them how a perishing nature desires better
things;<a id='r540'></a><a href='#f540' class='c007'><sup>[540]</sup></a> for it is like an evil tree producing good fruit,
since it is a virtuous act to desire better things. They
will give [perhaps] a third answer, that to desire and run
after what is good is one of those things that are indifferent,<a id='r541'></a><a href='#f541' class='c007'><sup>[541]</sup></a>
and neither beautiful<a id='r542'></a><a href='#f542' class='c007'><sup>[542]</sup></a> nor wicked. Now to this we
must say, that if to desire and to run after what is good
be a thing of indifference, then the opposite also is a thing
of indifference, viz. to desire what is evil, and to run after
it. But it is not a thing of indifference to desire what is
evil, and to run after it. And therefore also, to desire what
is good, and to run after it, is not a thing of indifference.
Such, then, is the defence which I think we can offer to the
statement, that “it is not of him that willeth, nor of him
that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy.”<a id='r543'></a><a href='#f543' class='c007'><sup>[543]</sup></a> Solomon
says in the book of Psalms (for the song of Degrees<a id='r544'></a><a href='#f544' class='c007'><sup>[544]</sup></a> is his,
from which we shall quote the words): “Unless the Lord
build the house, they labour in vain that build it; except the
Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh in vain:”<a id='r545'></a><a href='#f545' class='c007'><sup>[545]</sup></a> not
dissuading us from building, nor teaching us not to keep
watch in order to guard the city in our soul, but showing
that what is built without God, and does not receive a guard
from Him, is built in vain and watched to no purpose, because
God might reasonably be entitled the Lord of the building;
and the Governor of all things, the Ruler of the guard of
the city. As, then, if we were to say that such a building
is not the work of the builder, but of God, and that it was
not owing to the successful effort of the watcher, but of the
God who is over all, that such a city suffered no injury from
its enemies, we should not be wrong,<a id='r546'></a><a href='#f546' class='c007'><sup>[546]</sup></a> it being understood
that something also had been done by human means, but the
benefit being gratefully referred to God who brought it to
pass; so, seeing that the [mere] human desire is not sufficient
to attain the end, and that the running of those who are, as
it were, athletes, does not enable them to gain the prize of
the high calling of God in Christ Jesus—for these things
are accomplished with the assistance of God—it is well said
that “it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth,
but of God that showeth mercy.” As if also it were said
with regard to husbandry what also is actually recorded: “I
planted, Apollos watered; and God gave the increase. So
then neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that
watereth; but God that giveth the increase.”<a id='r547'></a><a href='#f547' class='c007'><sup>[547]</sup></a> Now we could
not piously assert that the production of full crops was the
work of the husbandman, or of him that watered, but the
work of God. So also our own perfection is brought about,
not as if we ourselves did nothing;<a id='r548'></a><a href='#f548' class='c007'><sup>[548]</sup></a> for it is not completed<a id='r549'></a><a href='#f549' class='c007'><sup>[549]</sup></a>
by us, but God produces the greater part of it. And that
this assertion may be more clearly believed, we shall take an
illustration from the art of navigation. For in comparison
with the effect of the winds,<a id='r550'></a><a href='#f550' class='c007'><sup>[550]</sup></a> and the mildness of the air,<a id='r551'></a><a href='#f551' class='c007'><sup>[551]</sup></a>
and the light of the stars, all co-operating in the preservation
of the crew, what proportion<a id='r552'></a><a href='#f552' class='c007'><sup>[552]</sup></a> could the art of navigation be
said to bear in the bringing of the ship into harbour?—since
even the sailors themselves, from piety, do not venture to assert
often that they had saved the ship, but refer all to God; not
as if they had done nothing, but because what had been
done by Providence was infinitely<a id='r553'></a><a href='#f553' class='c007'><sup>[553]</sup></a> greater than what had been
effected by their art. And in the matter of our salvation,
what is done by God is infinitely greater than what is done
by ourselves; and therefore, I think, is it said that “it is
not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God
that showeth mercy.” For if in the manner which they
imagine we must explain the statement,<a id='r554'></a><a href='#f554' class='c007'><sup>[554]</sup></a> that “it is not of
him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that
showeth mercy,” the commandments are superfluous; and it
is in vain that Paul himself blames some for having fallen
away, and approves of others as having remained upright,
and enacts laws for the churches: it is in vain also that we
give ourselves up to desire better things, and in vain also [to
attempt] to run. But it is not in vain that Paul gives such
advice, censuring some and approving of others; nor in vain
that we give ourselves up to the desire of better things,
and to the chase after things that are pre-eminent. They
have accordingly not well explained the meaning of the
passage.<a id='r555'></a><a href='#f555' class='c007'><sup>[555]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>19. After this there followed this point, that “to will and
to do are of God.”<a id='r556'></a><a href='#f556' class='c007'><sup>[556]</sup></a> Our opponents maintain that if to will
be of God, and if to do be of Him, or if, whether we act or
desire well or ill, it be of God, then in that case we are not
possessed of free-will. Now to this we have to answer, that
the words of the apostle do not say that to will evil is of God,
or that to will good is of Him; nor that to do good or evil is
of God; but his statement is a general one, that to will and to
do are of God. For as we have from God this very quality,
that we are men,<a id='r557'></a><a href='#f557' class='c007'><sup>[557]</sup></a> that we breathe, that we move; so also we
have from God [the faculty] by which we will, as if we were
to say that our power of motion is from God,<a id='r558'></a><a href='#f558' class='c007'><sup>[558]</sup></a> or that the
performing of these duties by the individual members, and
their movements, are from God. From which, certainly, I
do not understand this, that because the hand moves, <i>e.g.</i> to
punish unjustly, or to commit an act of theft, the act is of
God, but only that the power of motion<a id='r559'></a><a href='#f559' class='c007'><sup>[559]</sup></a> is from God; while
it is our duty to turn those movements, the power of executing
which we have from God, either to purposes of good or
evil. And so what the apostle says is, that we receive indeed
the power of volition, but that we misuse the will either to
good or evil desires. In a similar way, also, we must judge
of results.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>FROM THE GREEK.</h4>
<p class='c005'>19. Besides these, there is the passage, “Both to will and
to do are of God.”<a id='r560'></a><a href='#f560' class='c007'><sup>[560]</sup></a> And some assert that, if to will be of
God, and to do be of God, and if, whether we will evil or do
evil, these [movements] come to us from God, then, if so, we
are not possessed of free-will. But again, on the other hand,
when we will better things, and do things that are more excellent,<a id='r561'></a><a href='#f561' class='c007'><sup>[561]</sup></a>
seeing that willing and doing are from God, it is not
we who have done the more excellent things, but we only
appeared [to perform them], while it was God that bestowed
them;<a id='r562'></a><a href='#f562' class='c007'><sup>[562]</sup></a> so that even in this respect we do not possess free-will.
Now to this we have to answer, that the language of
the apostle does not assert that to will evil is of God, or to
will good is of Him (and similarly with respect to doing
better and worse); but that to will in a general<a id='r563'></a><a href='#f563' class='c007'><sup>[563]</sup></a> way, and
to run in a general way, [are from Him]. For as we have
from God [the property] of being living things and human
beings, so also have we that of willing generally, and, so to
speak, of motion in general. And as, possessing [the property]
of life and of motion, and of moving, <i>e.g.</i> these members,
the hands or the feet, we could not rightly say<a id='r564'></a><a href='#f564' class='c007'><sup>[564]</sup></a> that
we had from God this species of motion,<a id='r565'></a><a href='#f565' class='c007'><sup>[565]</sup></a> whereby we moved
to strike, or destroy, or take away another’s goods, but that
we had received from Him simply the generic<a id='r566'></a><a href='#f566' class='c007'><sup>[566]</sup></a> power of
motion, which we employed to better or worse purposes; so
we have obtained from God [the power] of acting, in respect
of our being living things, and [the power] to will from the
Creator,<a id='r567'></a><a href='#f567' class='c007'><sup>[567]</sup></a> while we employ the power of will, as well as that
of action, for the noblest objects, or the opposite.</p>

<p class='c005'>20. But with respect to the declaration of the apostle,
“Therefore hath He mercy on whom He will have mercy,
and whom He will He hardeneth. Thou wilt say then unto
me, Why doth He yet find fault? For who hath resisted His
will? Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against
God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it,
Why hast thou made me thus? Hath not the potter power
over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto
honour, and another unto dishonour?”<a id='r568'></a><a href='#f568' class='c007'><sup>[568]</sup></a> Some one will perhaps
say, that as the potter out of the same lump makes some
vessels to honour, and others to dishonour, so God creates
some men for perdition, and others for salvation; and that
it is not therefore in our own power either to be saved or to
perish; by which reasoning we appear not to be possessed of
free-will. We must answer those who are of this opinion
with the question, Whether it is possible for the apostle to
contradict himself? And if this cannot be imagined of
an apostle, how shall he appear, according to them, to be
just in blaming those who committed fornication in Corinth,
or those who sinned, and did not repent of their unchastity,
and fornication, and uncleanness, which they had
committed? How, also, does he greatly praise those who
acted rightly, like the house of Onesiphorus, saying, “The
Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus; for he
oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain: but,
when he had come to Rome, he sought me out very diligently,
and found me. The Lord grant unto him that he
may find mercy of the Lord in that day.”<a id='r569'></a><a href='#f569' class='c007'><sup>[569]</sup></a> Now it is not
consistent with apostolic gravity to blame him who is worthy
of blame, <i>i.e.</i> who has sinned, and greatly to praise him who
is deserving of praise for his good works; and again, as if it
were in no one’s power to do any good or evil, to say that it
was the Creator’s doing that every one should act virtuously
or wickedly, seeing He makes one vessel to honour, and
another to dishonour. And how can he add that statement,
“We must all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ,
that every one of us may receive in his body, according to
what he hath done, whether it be good or bad?”<a id='r570'></a><a href='#f570' class='c007'><sup>[570]</sup></a> For what
reward of good will be conferred on him who could not
commit evil, being formed by the Creator to that very end?
or what punishment will deservedly be inflicted on him who
was unable to do good in consequence of the creative act
of his Maker?<a id='r571'></a><a href='#f571' class='c007'><sup>[571]</sup></a> Then, again, how is not this opposed to
that other declaration elsewhere, that “in a great house
there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood
and of earth, and some to honour, and some to dishonour.
If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a
vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the Master’s
use, prepared unto every good work.”<a id='r572'></a><a href='#f572' class='c007'><sup>[572]</sup></a> He, accordingly, who
purges himself, is made a vessel unto honour, while he who
has disdained to cleanse himself from his impurity is made a
vessel unto dishonour. From such declarations, in my opinion,
the cause of our actions can in no degree be referred to the
Creator. For God the Creator makes a certain vessel unto
honour, and other vessels to dishonour; but that vessel which
has cleansed itself from all impurity He makes a vessel unto
honour, while that which has stained itself with the filth of
vice He makes a vessel unto dishonour. The conclusion
from which, accordingly, is this, that the cause of each one’s
actions is a pre-existing one; and then every one, according
to his deserts, is made by God either a vessel unto honour or
dishonour. Therefore every individual vessel has furnished
to its Creator out of itself the causes and occasions of its
being formed by Him to be either a vessel unto honour or
one unto dishonour. And if the assertion appear correct, as
it certainly is, and in harmony with all piety, that it is due
to previous causes that every vessel be prepared by God
either to honour or to dishonour, it does not appear absurd
that, in discussing remoter causes in the same order, and in
the same method, we should come to the same conclusion
respecting the nature of souls, and [believe] that this was the
reason why Jacob was beloved before he was born into this
world, and Esau hated, while he still was contained in the
womb of his mother.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>FROM THE GREEK.</h4>
<p class='c005'>20. Still the declaration of the apostle will appear to drag
us to the conclusion that we are not possessed of freedom of
will, in which, objecting against himself, he says, “Therefore
hath He mercy on whom He will have mercy, and whom
He will He hardeneth. Thou wilt say then unto me, Why
doth He yet find fault? For who hath resisted His will?
Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God?
Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast
thou made me thus? Hath not the potter power over the
clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and
another unto dishonour?”<a id='r573'></a><a href='#f573' class='c007'><sup>[573]</sup></a> For it will be said: If the potter
of the same lump make some vessels to honour and others to
dishonour, and God thus form some men for salvation and
others for ruin, then salvation or ruin does not depend upon
ourselves, nor are we possessed of free-will. Now we must
ask him who deals so with these passages, whether it is possible
to conceive of the apostle as contradicting himself. I
presume, however, that no one will venture to say so. If,
then, the apostle does not utter contradictions, how can he,
according to him who so understands him, reasonably find
fault, censuring the individual at Corinth who had committed
fornication, or those who had fallen away, and had
not repented of the licentiousness and impurity of which
they had been guilty? And how can he bless those whom
he praises as having done well, as he does the house of
Onesiphorus in these words: “The Lord give mercy to the
house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not
ashamed of my chain: but, when he was in Rome, he sought
me out very diligently, and found me. The Lord grant to
him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day.”<a id='r574'></a><a href='#f574' class='c007'><sup>[574]</sup></a> It
is not consistent for the same apostle<a id='r575'></a><a href='#f575' class='c007'><sup>[575]</sup></a> to blame the sinner as
worthy of censure, and to praise him who had done well as
deserving of approval; and again, on the other hand, to say,
as if nothing depended on ourselves, that the cause was in
the Creator<a id='r576'></a><a href='#f576' class='c007'><sup>[576]</sup></a> why the one vessel was formed to honour, and
the other to dishonour. And how is this statement correct:<a id='r577'></a><a href='#f577' class='c007'><sup>[577]</sup></a>
“For we must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ;
that every one may receive the things done in his body, according
to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad,”<a id='r578'></a><a href='#f578' class='c007'><sup>[578]</sup></a>
since they who have done evil have advanced to this pitch
of wickedness<a id='r579'></a><a href='#f579' class='c007'><sup>[579]</sup></a> because they were created vessels unto dishonour,
while they that have lived virtuously have done good
because they were created from the beginning for this purpose,
and became vessels unto honour? And again, how
does not the statement made elsewhere conflict with the view
which these persons draw from the words which we have
quoted (that it is the fault of the Creator that one vessel is
in honour and another in dishonour), viz. “that in a great
house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also
of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to
dishonour. If a man therefore purge himself, he shall be a
vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the Master’s use,
and prepared unto every good work;”<a id='r580'></a><a href='#f580' class='c007'><sup>[580]</sup></a> for if he who purges
himself becomes a vessel unto honour, and he who allows
himself to remain unpurged<a id='r581'></a><a href='#f581' class='c007'><sup>[581]</sup></a> becomes a vessel unto dishonour,
then, so far as these words are concerned, the Creator is not
at all to blame. For the Creator makes vessels of honour
and vessels of dishonour, not from the beginning according
to His foreknowledge,<a id='r582'></a><a href='#f582' class='c007'><sup>[582]</sup></a> since He does not condemn or justify
beforehand<a id='r583'></a><a href='#f583' class='c007'><sup>[583]</sup></a> according to it; but [He makes] those into vessels
of honour who purged themselves, and those into vessels of dishonour
who allowed themselves to remain unpurged: so that
it results from older causes<a id='r584'></a><a href='#f584' class='c007'><sup>[584]</sup></a> [which operated] in the formation
of the vessels unto honour and dishonour, that one was
created for the former condition, and another for the latter.
But if we once admit that there were certain older causes [at
work] in the forming of a vessel unto honour, and of one
unto dishonour, what absurdity is there in going back to the
subject of the soul, and [in supposing] that a more ancient
cause for Jacob being loved and for Esau being hated existed
with respect to Jacob before his assumption of a body, and
with regard to Esau before he was conceived in the womb of
Rebecca?</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>FROM THE LATIN.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c005'>21. Nay, that very declaration, that from the same lump
a vessel is formed both to honour and to dishonour, will not
push us hard; for we assert that the nature of all rational
souls is the same, as one lump of clay is described as
being under the treatment of the potter. Seeing, then, the
nature of rational creatures is one, God, according to the
previous grounds of merit,<a id='r585'></a><a href='#f585' class='c007'><sup>[585]</sup></a> created and formed out of it, as
the potter out of the one lump, some persons to honour and
others to dishonour. Now, as regards the language of the
apostle, which he utters as if in a tone of censure, “Nay but,
O man, who art thou that repliest against God?” he means,
I think, to point out that such a censure does not refer to
any believer who lives rightly and justly, and who has confidence
in God, <i>i.e.</i> to such an one as Moses was, of whom
Scripture says that “Moses spake, and God answered him by
a voice;”<a id='r586'></a><a href='#f586' class='c007'><sup>[586]</sup></a> and as God answered Moses, so also does every
saint answer God. But he who is an unbeliever, and loses
confidence in answering before God owing to the unworthiness
of his life and conversation, and who, in relation to these
matters, does not seek to learn and make progress, but to
oppose and resist, and who, to speak more plainly, is such an
one as to be able to say those words which the apostle indicates,
when he says, “Why, then, does He yet find fault? for who
will resist His will?”—to such an one may the censure of
the apostle rightly be directed, “Nay but, O man, who art
thou that repliest against God?” This censure accordingly
applies not to believers and saints, but to unbelievers and
wicked men.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now, to those who introduce souls of different natures,<a id='r587'></a><a href='#f587' class='c007'><sup>[587]</sup></a>
and who turn this declaration of the apostle to the support
of their own opinion, we have to reply as follows: If even
they are agreed as to what the apostle says, that out of the
one lump are formed both those who are made to honour
and those who are made to dishonour, whom they term of a
nature that is to be saved and destroyed, there will then be
no longer souls of different natures, but one nature for all.
And if they admit that one and the same potter may undoubtedly
denote one Creator, there will not be different
creators either of those who are saved, or of those who perish.
Now, truly, let them choose whether they will have a good
Creator to be intended who creates bad and ruined men, or
one who is not good, who creates good men and those who
are prepared to honour. For the necessity of returning an
answer will extort from them one of these two alternatives.
But according to our declaration, whereby we say that it is
owing to preceding causes that God makes vessels either to
honour or to dishonour, the approval of God’s justice is in
no respect limited. For it is possible that this vessel, which
owing to previous causes was made in this world to honour,
may, if it behave negligently, be converted in another world,
according to the deserts of its conduct, into a vessel unto
dishonour: as again, if any one, owing to preceding causes,
was formed by his Creator in this life a vessel unto dishonour,
and shall mend his ways and cleanse himself from all filth
and vice, he may, in the new world, be made a vessel to
honour, sanctified and useful, and prepared unto every good
work. Finally, those who were formed by God in this world
to be Israelites, and who have lived a life unworthy of the
nobility of their race, and have fallen away from the grandeur
of their descent, will, in the world to come, in a certain degree<a id='r588'></a><a href='#f588' class='c007'><sup>[588]</sup></a>
be converted, on account of their unbelief, from vessels of
honour into vessels of dishonour; while, on the other hand,
many who in this life were reckoned among Egyptian or
Idumean vessels, having adopted the faith and practice of
Israelites, when they shall have done the works of Israelites,
and shall have entered the church of the Lord, will exist
as vessels of honour in the revelation of the sons of God.
From which it is more agreeable to the rule of piety to
believe that every rational being, according to his purpose
and manner of life, is converted, sometimes from bad to
good, and falls away sometimes from good to bad: that some
abide in good, and others advance to a better condition, and
always ascend to higher things, until they reach the highest
grade of all; while others, again, remain in evil, or, if the
wickedness within them begin to spread itself further, they
descend to a worse condition, and sink into the lowest depth
of wickedness. Whence also we must suppose that it is possible
there may be some who began at first indeed with small
offences, but who have poured out wickedness to such a degree,
and attained such proficiency in evil, that in the measure of
their wickedness they are equal even to the opposing powers:
and again, if, by means of many severe administrations of
punishment, they are able at some future time to recover
their senses, and gradually attempt to find healing for their
wounds, they may, on ceasing from their wickedness, be
restored to a state of goodness. Whence we are of opinion
that, seeing the soul, as we have frequently said, is immortal
and eternal, it is possible that, in the many and endless periods
of duration in the immeasurable and different worlds, it may
descend from the highest good to the lowest evil, or be
restored from the lowest evil to the highest good.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>FROM THE GREEK.</h4>
<p class='c005'>21. And at the same time, it is clearly shown that, as far
as regards the underlying nature,<a id='r589'></a><a href='#f589' class='c007'><sup>[589]</sup></a> as there is one [piece of]
clay which is under the hands of the potter, from which
piece vessels are formed unto honour and dishonour; so the
one nature of every soul being in the hands of God, and, so
to speak, there being [only] one lump of reasonable beings,<a id='r590'></a><a href='#f590' class='c007'><sup>[590]</sup></a>
certain causes of more ancient date led to some being created
vessels unto honour, and others vessels unto dishonour. But
if the language of the apostle convey a censure when he says,
“Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God?”
it teaches us that he who has confidence before God, and is
faithful, and has lived virtuously, would not hear the words,
“Who art thou that repliest against God?” Such an one,
<i>e.g.</i>, as Moses was, “For Moses spake, and God answered
him with a voice;”<a id='r591'></a><a href='#f591' class='c007'><sup>[591]</sup></a> and as God answers Moses, so does a
saint also answer God. But he who does not possess this
confidence, manifestly, either because he has lost it, or because
he investigates these matters not from a love of knowledge,
but from a desire to find fault,<a id='r592'></a><a href='#f592' class='c007'><sup>[592]</sup></a> and who therefore says,
“Why does He yet find fault? for who hath resisted His will?”
would merit the language of censure, which says, “Nay but,
O man, who art thou that repliest against God?” Now to
those who introduce different natures, and who make use of
the declaration of the apostle [to support their view], the
following must be our answer. If they maintain<a id='r593'></a><a href='#f593' class='c007'><sup>[593]</sup></a> that those
who perish and those who are saved are formed of one lump,
and that the Creator of those who are saved is the Creator
also of them who are lost, and if He is good who creates not
only spiritual but also earthy [natures] (for this follows from
their view), it is nevertheless possible that he who, in consequence
of certain former acts of righteousness,<a id='r594'></a><a href='#f594' class='c007'><sup>[594]</sup></a> had now been
made a vessel of honour, but who had not [afterwards] acted
in a similar manner, nor done things befitting a vessel of
honour, was converted in another world into a vessel of dishonour;
as, on the other hand, it is possible that he who,
owing to causes more ancient than the present life, was here
a vessel of dishonour, may after reformation become in the
new creation “a vessel of honour, sanctified and meet for the
Master’s use, prepared unto every good work.” And perhaps
those who are now Israelites, not having lived worthily of
their descent, will be deprived of their rank, being changed,
as it were, from vessels of honour into those of dishonour;
and many of the present Egyptians and Idumeans who came
near to Israel, when they shall have borne fruit to a larger
extent, shall enter into the church of the Lord, being no
longer accounted Egyptians and Idumeans, but becoming
Israelites: so that, according to this view, it is owing to their
[varying] purposes that some advance from a worse to a better
condition, and others fall from better to worse; while others,
again, are preserved in a virtuous course, or ascend from good
to better; and others, on the contrary, remain in a course of
evil, or from bad become worse, as their wickedness flows on.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>FROM THE LATIN.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c005'>22. But since the words of the apostle, in what he says
regarding vessels of honour or dishonour, that “if a man
therefore purge himself, he will be a vessel unto honour, sanctified
and meet for the Master’s service, and prepared unto
every good work,” appear to place nothing in the power of
God, but all in ourselves; while in those in which he declares
that “the potter hath power over the clay, to make of the same
lump one vessel to honour, another to dishonour,” he seems
to refer the whole to God,—it is not to be understood that
those statements are contradictory, but the two meanings are
to be reduced to agreement, and one signification must be
drawn from both, viz. that we are not to suppose either that
those things which are in our own power can be done
without the help of God, or that those which are in God’s
hand can be brought to completion without the intervention
of our acts, and desires, and intention; because we have it
not in our own power so to will or do anything, as not to
know that this very faculty, by which we are able to will or
to do, was bestowed on us by God, according to the distinction
which we indicated above. Or again, when God forms
vessels, some to honour and others to dishonour, we are to
suppose that He does not regard either our wills, or our purposes,
or our deserts, to be the causes of the honour or dishonour,
as if they were a sort of matter from which He may
form the vessel of each one of us either to honour or to dishonour;
whereas the very movement of the soul itself, or the
purpose of the understanding, may of itself suggest to him,
who is not unaware of his heart and the thoughts of his mind,
whether his vessel ought to be formed to honour or to dishonour.
But let these points suffice, which we have discussed
as we best could, regarding the questions connected with the
freedom of the will.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>FROM THE GREEK.</h4>
<p class='c005'>22. But since the apostle in one place does not pretend
that the becoming of a vessel unto honour or dishonour
depends upon God, but refers back the whole to ourselves,
saying, “If, then, a man purge himself, he will be a vessel
unto honour, sanctified, meet for the Master’s use, and prepared
unto every good work;” and elsewhere does not even
pretend that it is dependent upon ourselves, but appears to
attribute the whole to God, saying, “The potter hath power
over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto
honour and another to dishonour;” and as his statements are
not contradictory, we must reconcile them, and extract one
complete statement from both. Neither does our own power,<a id='r595'></a><a href='#f595' class='c007'><sup>[595]</sup></a>
apart from the knowledge<a id='r596'></a><a href='#f596' class='c007'><sup>[596]</sup></a> of God, compel us to make progress;
nor does the knowledge of God [do so], unless we ourselves
also contribute something to the good result; nor does
our own power, apart from the knowledge of God, and the
use of the power that worthily belongs to us,<a id='r597'></a><a href='#f597' class='c007'><sup>[597]</sup></a> make a man
become [a vessel] unto honour or dishonour; nor does the
will of God alone<a id='r598'></a><a href='#f598' class='c007'><sup>[598]</sup></a> form a man to honour or dishonour, unless
He hold our will to be a kind of matter that admits of variation,<a id='r599'></a><a href='#f599' class='c007'><sup>[599]</sup></a>
and that inclines to a better or worse course of conduct.
And these observations are sufficient to have been made by
us on the subject of free-will.</p>

  <h4 id='de-principiis-b3-c2' class='c010'>CHAPTER <abbr title='two'>II.</abbr> <br> ON THE OPPOSING POWERS.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c005'>1. We have now to notice, agreeably to the statements
of Scripture, how the opposing powers, or the devil himself,
contends with the human race, inciting and instigating men
to sin. And in the first place, in the book of Genesis,<a id='r600'></a><a href='#f600' class='c007'><sup>[600]</sup></a> the
serpent is described as having seduced Eve; regarding
whom, in the work entitled <i>The Ascension of Moses</i><a id='r601'></a><a href='#f601' class='c007'><sup>[601]</sup></a> (a little
treatise, of which the Apostle Jude makes mention in his
epistle), the archangel Michael, when disputing with the
devil regarding the body of Moses, says that the serpent,
being inspired by the devil, was the cause of Adam and
Eve’s transgression. This also is made a subject of inquiry
by some, viz. who the angel was that, speaking from heaven
to Abraham, said, “Now I know that thou fearest God, and
on my account hast not spared thy beloved son, whom thou
lovedst.”<a id='r602'></a><a href='#f602' class='c007'><sup>[602]</sup></a> For he is manifestly described as an angel who
said that he knew then that Abraham feared God, and
had not spared his beloved son, as the Scripture declares,
although he did not say that it was on account of God that
Abraham had done this, but on his, that is, the speaker’s
account. We must also ascertain who that is of whom it is
stated in the book of Exodus that he wished to slay Moses,
because he was taking his departure for Egypt;<a id='r603'></a><a href='#f603' class='c007'><sup>[603]</sup></a> and afterwards,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>also, who he is that is called the destroying<a id='r604'></a><a href='#f604' class='c007'><sup>[604]</sup></a> angel, as
well as he who in the book of Leviticus is called Apopompæus,
<i>i.e.</i> Averter, regarding whom Scripture says, “One lot
for the Lord, and one lot for Apopompæus, <i>i.e.</i> the Averter.”<a id='r605'></a><a href='#f605' class='c007'><sup>[605]</sup></a>
In the first book of Kings, also, an evil spirit is said to
strangle<a id='r606'></a><a href='#f606' class='c007'><sup>[606]</sup></a> Saul; and in the third book, Micaiah the prophet
says, “I saw the Lord of Israel sitting on His throne, and
all the host of heaven standing by Him, on His right hand
and on His left. And the Lord said, Who will deceive
Achab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?
And one said on this manner, and another said on
that manner. And there came forth a spirit, and stood before
the Lord, and said, I will deceive him. And the Lord said
to him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and I
will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And
he said, Thou shalt deceive him, and prevail also: go forth,
and do so quickly. And now therefore the Lord hath put
a lying spirit in the mouth of all thy prophets: the Lord
hath spoken evil concerning thee.”<a id='r607'></a><a href='#f607' class='c007'><sup>[607]</sup></a> Now by this last quotation
it is clearly shown that a certain spirit, from his own
[free] will and choice, elected to deceive [Achab], and to
work a lie, in order that the Lord might mislead the king to
his death, for he deserved to suffer. In the first book of
Chronicles also it is said, “The devil, Satan, stood up against
Israel, and provoked David to number the people.”<a id='r608'></a><a href='#f608' class='c007'><sup>[608]</sup></a> In the
Psalms, moreover, an evil angel is said to harass<a id='r609'></a><a href='#f609' class='c007'><sup>[609]</sup></a> certain
persons. In the book of Ecclesiastes, too, Solomon says,
“If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy
place; for soundness will restrain many transgressions.”<a id='r610'></a><a href='#f610' class='c007'><sup>[610]</sup></a> In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>Zechariah<a id='r611'></a><a href='#f611' class='c007'><sup>[611]</sup></a> we read that the devil stood on the right hand of
Joshua, and resisted him. Isaiah says that the sword of the
Lord arises against the dragon, the crooked<a id='r612'></a><a href='#f612' class='c007'><sup>[612]</sup></a> serpent.<a id='r613'></a><a href='#f613' class='c007'><sup>[613]</sup></a> And
what shall I say of Ezekiel, who in his second vision prophesies
most unmistakeably to the prince of Tyre regarding
an opposing power, and who says also that the dragon
dwells in the rivers of Egypt?<a id='r614'></a><a href='#f614' class='c007'><sup>[614]</sup></a> Nay, with what else are the
contents of the whole work which is written regarding Job
occupied, save with the [doings] of the devil, who asks that
power may be given him over all that Job possesses, and over
his sons, and even over his person? And yet the devil is
defeated through the patience of Job. In that book the Lord
has by His answers imparted much information regarding the
power of that dragon which opposes us. Such, meanwhile,
are the statements made in the Old Testament, so far as we
can at present recall them, on the subject of hostile powers
being either named in Scripture, or being said to oppose the
human race, and to be afterwards subjected to punishment.</p>

<p class='c006'>Let us now look also to the New Testament, where Satan
approaches the Saviour, and tempts Him: wherein also it
is stated that evil spirits and unclean demons, which had
taken possession of very many, were expelled by the Saviour
from the bodies of the sufferers, who are said also to be
made free by Him. Even Judas, too, when the devil had
already put it in his heart to betray Christ, afterwards received
Satan wholly into him; for it is written, that after
the sop “Satan entered into him.”<a id='r615'></a><a href='#f615' class='c007'><sup>[615]</sup></a> And the Apostle Paul
teaches us that we ought not to give place to the devil; but
“put on,” he says, “the armour of God, that ye may be
able to resist the wiles of the devil:”<a id='r616'></a><a href='#f616' class='c007'><sup>[616]</sup></a> pointing out that
the saints have to “<i>wrestle</i> not against flesh and blood, but
against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of
the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>places.”<a id='r617'></a><a href='#f617' class='c007'><sup>[617]</sup></a> Nay, he says that the Saviour even was crucified
by the princes of this world, who shall come to nought,<a id='r618'></a><a href='#f618' class='c007'><sup>[618]</sup></a>
whose wisdom also, he says, he does not speak. By all this,
therefore, holy Scripture teaches us that there are certain
invisible enemies that fight against us, and against whom it
commands us to arm ourselves. Whence, also, the more
simple among the believers in the Lord Christ are of opinion,
that all the sins which men have committed are caused by
the persistent efforts of these opposing powers exerted upon
the minds of sinners, because in that invisible struggle these
powers are found to be superior [to man]. For if, for
example, there were no devil, no single human being<a id='r619'></a><a href='#f619' class='c007'><sup>[619]</sup></a> would
go astray.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. We, however, who see the reason [of the thing] more
clearly, do not hold this opinion, taking into account those
[sins] which manifestly originate as a necessary consequence
of our bodily constitution.<a id='r620'></a><a href='#f620' class='c007'><sup>[620]</sup></a> Must we indeed suppose that
the devil is the cause of our feeling hunger or thirst? Nobody,
I think, will venture to maintain that. If, then, he is
not the cause of our feeling hunger and thirst, wherein lies
the difference when each individual has attained the age of
puberty, and that period has called forth the incentives of
the natural heat? It will undoubtedly follow, that as the
devil is not the cause of our feeling hunger and thirst, so
neither is he the cause of that appetency which naturally
arises at the time of maturity, viz. the desire of sexual intercourse.
Now it is certain that this cause is not always so
set in motion by the devil that we should be obliged to
suppose that bodies would not possess a desire for intercourse
of that kind if the devil did not exist. Let us consider, in
the next place, if, as we have already shown, food is desired
by human beings, not from a suggestion of the devil, but by
a kind of natural instinct, whether, if there were no devil,
it were possible for human experience to exhibit such restraint
in partaking of food as never to exceed the proper limits;
<i>i.e.</i> that no one would either take otherwise than the case
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>required, or more than reason would allow; and so it would
result that men, observing due measure and moderation in
the matter of eating, would never go wrong. I do not think,
indeed, that so great moderation could be observed by men
(even if there were no instigation by the devil inciting
thereto), as that no individual, in partaking of food, would
go beyond due limits and restraint, until he had learned to
do so from long usage and experience. What, then, is the
state of the case? In the matter of eating and drinking it
was possible for us to go wrong, even without any incitement
from the devil, if we should happen to be either less temperate
or less careful [than we ought]; and are we to suppose,
then, in our appetite for sexual intercourse, or in the restraint
of our natural desires, our condition is not something similar?<a id='r621'></a><a href='#f621' class='c007'><sup>[621]</sup></a>
I am of opinion, indeed, that the same course of
reasoning must be understood to apply to other natural movements,
as those of covetousness, or of anger, or of sorrow, or
of all those generally which through the vice of intemperance
exceed the natural bounds of moderation. There are therefore
manifest reasons for holding the opinion, that as in good
things the human will<a id='r622'></a><a href='#f622' class='c007'><sup>[622]</sup></a> is of itself weak to accomplish any
good (for it is by divine help that it is brought to perfection
in everything); so also, in things of an opposite nature we
receive certain initial elements, and, as it were, seeds of sins,
from those things which we use agreeably to nature;<a id='r623'></a><a href='#f623' class='c007'><sup>[623]</sup></a> but
when we have indulged them beyond what is proper, and
have not resisted the first movements to intemperance, then
the hostile power, seizing the occasion of this first transgression,
incites and presses us hard in every way, seeking to
extend our sins over a wider field, and furnishing us human
beings with occasions and beginnings of sins, which these
hostile powers spread far and wide, and, if possible, beyond
all limits. Thus, when men at first for a little desire money,
covetousness begins to grow as the passion increases, and
finally the fall into avarice takes place. And after this,
when blindness of mind has succeeded passion, and the hostile
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>powers, by their suggestions, hurry on the mind, money is
now no longer desired, but stolen, and acquired by force, or
even by shedding human blood. Finally, a confirmatory
evidence of the fact that vices of such enormity proceed from
demons, may be easily seen in this, that those individuals
who are oppressed either by immoderate love, or incontrollable
anger, or excessive sorrow, do not suffer less than those who
are bodily vexed by devils. For it is recorded in certain
histories, that some have fallen into madness from a state of
love, others from a state of anger, not a few from a state of
sorrow, and even from one of excessive joy; which results,
I think, from this, that those opposing powers, <i>i.e.</i> those
demons, having gained a lodgment in their minds which
has been already laid open to them by intemperance, have
taken complete possession of their sensitive nature,<a id='r624'></a><a href='#f624' class='c007'><sup>[624]</sup></a> especially
when no feeling of the glory of virtue has aroused them to
resistance.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. That there are certain sins, however, which do not proceed
from the opposing powers, but take their beginnings
from the natural movements of the body, is manifestly
declared by the Apostle Paul in the passage: “The flesh
lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh:
and these are contrary the one to the other; so that ye cannot
do the things that ye would.”<a id='r625'></a><a href='#f625' class='c007'><sup>[625]</sup></a> If, then, the flesh lust
against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh, we have
occasionally to wrestle against flesh and blood, <i>i.e.</i> as being
men, and walking according to the flesh, and not capable
of being tempted by greater than human temptations; since
it is said of us, “There hath no temptation taken you, but
such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will
not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able.”<a id='r626'></a><a href='#f626' class='c007'><sup>[626]</sup></a> For
as the presidents of the public games do not allow the competitors
to enter the lists indiscriminately or fortuitously, but
after a careful examination, pairing in a most impartial consideration
either of size or age, this individual with that—boys,
<i>e.g.</i>, with boys, men with men, who are nearly related to each
other either in age or strength; so also must we understand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>the procedure of divine providence, which arranges on most
impartial principles all who descend into the struggles of this
human life, according to the nature of each individual’s
power, which is known only to Him who alone beholds the
hearts of men: so that one individual fights against one
temptation of the flesh,<a id='r627'></a><a href='#f627' class='c007'><sup>[627]</sup></a> another against a second; one is
exposed to its influence for so long a period of time, another
only for so long; one is tempted by the flesh to this or that
indulgence, another to one of a different kind; one has to
resist this or that hostile power, another has to combat two or
three at the same time; or at one time this hostile influence,
at another that; at some particular date having to resist one
enemy, and at another a different one; being, after the performance
of certain acts, exposed to one set of enemies, after
others to a second. And observe whether some such state of
things be not indicated by the language of the apostle: “God
is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above what
ye are able,”<a id='r628'></a><a href='#f628' class='c007'><sup>[628]</sup></a> <i>i.e.</i> each one is tempted in proportion to the
amount of his strength or power of resistance.<a id='r629'></a><a href='#f629' class='c007'><sup>[629]</sup></a> Now, although
we have said that it is by the just judgment of God that every
one is tempted according to the amount of his strength, we are
not therefore to suppose that he who is tempted ought by all
means to prove victorious in the struggle; in like manner as
he who contends in the lists, although paired with his adversary
on a just principle of arrangement, will nevertheless not
necessarily prove conqueror. But unless the powers of the
combatants are equal, the prize of the victor will not be justly
won; nor will blame justly attach to the vanquished, because
He allows us indeed to be tempted, but not “beyond what
we are able:” for it is in proportion to our strength that we
are tempted; and it is not written that, in temptation, He
will make also a way to escape so as that we should bear it,
but a way to escape so as that we should be able to bear
it.<a id='r630'></a><a href='#f630' class='c007'><sup>[630]</sup></a> But it depends upon ourselves to use either with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>energy or feebleness this power which He has given us. For
there is no doubt that under every temptation we have a
power of endurance, if we employ properly the strength that
is granted us. But it is not the same thing to possess the
<i>power</i> of conquering and to be victorious, as the apostle
himself has shown in very cautious language, saying, “God
will make a way to escape, that you may be <i>able</i> to bear it,”<a id='r631'></a><a href='#f631' class='c007'><sup>[631]</sup></a>
not that you <i>will</i> bear it. For many do not sustain temptation,
but are overcome by it. Now God enables us not to
sustain [temptation], [otherwise there would appear to be no
struggle], but to have the <i>power</i> of sustaining it.<a id='r632'></a><a href='#f632' class='c007'><sup>[632]</sup></a> But this
power which is given us to enable us to conquer may be
used, according to our faculty of free-will, either in a diligent
manner, and then we prove victorious, or in a slothful manner,
and then we are defeated. For if such a power were wholly
given us as that we must by all means prove victorious, and
never be defeated, what further reason for a struggle could
remain to him who cannot be overcome? Or what merit is
there in a victory, where the power of successful resistance<a id='r633'></a><a href='#f633' class='c007'><sup>[633]</sup></a>
is taken away? But if the possibility of conquering be
equally conferred on us all, and if it be in our own power how
to use this possibility, <i>i.e.</i> either diligently or slothfully, then
will the vanquished be justly censured, and the victor be
deservedly lauded. Now from these points which we have
discussed to the best of our power, it is, I think, clearly
evident that there are certain transgressions which we by no
means commit under the pressure of malignant powers; while
there are others, again, to which we are incited by instigation
on their part to excessive and immoderate indulgence.
Whence it follows that we have to inquire how those opposing
powers produce these incitements within us.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. With respect to the thoughts which proceed from our
heart, or the recollection of things which we have done, or
the contemplation of any things or causes whatever, we find
that they sometimes proceed from ourselves, and sometimes
are originated by the opposing powers; not seldom also are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>they suggested by God, or by the holy angels. Now such a
statement will perhaps appear incredible,<a id='r634'></a><a href='#f634' class='c007'><sup>[634]</sup></a> unless it be confirmed
by the testimony of holy Scripture. That, then,
thoughts arise within ourselves, David testifies in the Psalms,
saying, “The thought of a man will make confession to Thee,
and the rest of the thought shall observe to Thee a festival
day.”<a id='r635'></a><a href='#f635' class='c007'><sup>[635]</sup></a> That this, however, is also brought about by the
opposing powers, is shown by Solomon in the book of Ecclesiastes
in the following manner: “If the spirit of the ruler
rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for soundness
restrains great offences.”<a id='r636'></a><a href='#f636' class='c007'><sup>[636]</sup></a> The Apostle Paul also will bear
testimony to the same point in the words: “Casting down
imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against
the knowledge of Christ.”<a id='r637'></a><a href='#f637' class='c007'><sup>[637]</sup></a> That it is an effect due to God,
nevertheless, is declared by David, when he says in the
Psalms, “Blessed is the man whose help is in Thee, O Lord,
Thy ascents (are) in his heart.”<a id='r638'></a><a href='#f638' class='c007'><sup>[638]</sup></a> And the apostle says that
“God put it into the heart of Titus.”<a id='r639'></a><a href='#f639' class='c007'><sup>[639]</sup></a> That certain thoughts
are suggested to men’s hearts either by good or evil angels,
is shown both by the angel that accompanied Tobias, and by
the language of the prophet, where he says, “And the angel
who spoke in me answered.”<a id='r640'></a><a href='#f640' class='c007'><sup>[640]</sup></a> The book of the Shepherd<a id='r641'></a><a href='#f641' class='c007'><sup>[641]</sup></a>
declares the same, saying that each individual is attended by
two angels; that whenever good thoughts arise in our hearts,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>they are suggested by the good angel; but when of a contrary
kind, they are the instigation of the evil angel. The same
is declared by Barnabas in his epistle,<a id='r642'></a><a href='#f642' class='c007'><sup>[642]</sup></a> where he says there
are two ways, one of light and one of darkness, over which
he asserts that certain angels are placed,—the angels of God
over the way of light, the angels of Satan over the way of
darkness. We are not, however, to imagine that any other
result follows from what is suggested to our heart, whether
good or bad, save a [mental] commotion only, and an incitement
instigating us either to good or evil. For it is quite
within our reach, when a malignant power has begun to
incite us to evil, to cast away from us the wicked suggestions,
and to resist the vile inducements, and to do nothing that
is at all deserving of blame. And, on the other hand, it is
possible, when a divine power calls us to better things, not to
obey the call; our freedom of will being preserved to us in
either case. We said, indeed, in the foregoing pages, that
certain recollections of good or evil actions were suggested
to us either by the act of divine providence or by the opposing
powers, as is shown in the book of Esther, when Artaxerxes
had not remembered the services of that just man Mordecai,
but, when wearied out with his nightly vigils, had it put into
his mind by God to require that the annals of his great deeds
should be read to him; whereon, being reminded of the
benefits received from Mordecai, he ordered his enemy Haman
to be hanged, but splendid honours to be conferred on him,
and impunity from the threatened danger to be granted to
the whole of the holy nation. On the other hand, however,
we must suppose that it was through the hostile influence
of the devil that the suggestion was introduced into the
minds of the high priests and the scribes which they made to
Pilate, when they came and said, “Sir, we remember that
that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I
will rise again.”<a id='r643'></a><a href='#f643' class='c007'><sup>[643]</sup></a> The design of Judas, also, respecting the
betrayal of our Lord and Saviour, did not originate in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>wickedness of his mind alone. For Scripture testifies that
the “devil had already put it into his heart to betray Him.”<a id='r644'></a><a href='#f644' class='c007'><sup>[644]</sup></a>
And therefore Solomon rightly commanded, saying, “Keep
thy heart with all diligence.”<a id='r645'></a><a href='#f645' class='c007'><sup>[645]</sup></a> And the Apostle Paul warns
us: “Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the
things which we have heard, lest perhaps we should let them
slip.”<a id='r646'></a><a href='#f646' class='c007'><sup>[646]</sup></a> And when he says, “Neither give place to the devil,”<a id='r647'></a><a href='#f647' class='c007'><sup>[647]</sup></a>
he shows by that injunction that it is through certain acts, or
a kind of mental slothfulness, that room is made for the devil,
so that, if he once enter our heart, he will either gain possession
of us, or at least will pollute the soul, if he has not
obtained the entire mastery over it, by casting on us his fiery
darts; and by these we are sometimes deeply wounded, and
sometimes only set on fire. Seldom indeed, and only in a few
instances, are these fiery darts quenched, so as not to find a
place where they may wound, <i>i.e.</i> when one is covered by the
strong and mighty shield of faith. The declaration, indeed,
in the Epistle to the Ephesians, “We wrestle not against
flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers,
against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against
spiritual wickedness in high places,”<a id='r648'></a><a href='#f648' class='c007'><sup>[648]</sup></a> must be so understood
as if “we” meant, “I Paul, and you Ephesians, and all who
have not to wrestle against flesh and blood:” for such have
to struggle against principalities and powers, against the
rulers of the darkness of this world, not like the Corinthians,
whose struggle was as yet against flesh and blood, and who
had been overtaken by no temptation but such as is common
to man.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. We are not, however, to suppose that each individual
has to contend against all these [adversaries]. For it is impossible
for any man, although he were a saint, to carry on a
contest against all of them at the same time. If that indeed
were by any means to be the case, as it is certainly impossible
it should be so, human nature could not possibly bear it without
undergoing entire destruction.<a id='r649'></a><a href='#f649' class='c007'><sup>[649]</sup></a> But as, for example, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>fifty soldiers were to say that they were about to engage with
fifty others, they would not be understood to mean that one
of them had to contend against the whole fifty, but each
one would rightly say that “our battle was against fifty,”
all against all; so also this is to be understood as the apostle’s
meaning, that all the athletes and soldiers of Christ have to
wrestle and struggle against all the adversaries enumerated,—the
struggle having, indeed, to be maintained against all, but
by single individuals either with individual powers, or at least
in such manner as shall be determined by God, who is the just
president of the struggle. For I am of opinion that there is
a certain limit to the powers of human nature, although there
may be a Paul, of whom it is said, “He is a chosen vessel
unto me;”<a id='r650'></a><a href='#f650' class='c007'><sup>[650]</sup></a> or a Peter, against whom the gates of hell do
not prevail; or a Moses, the friend of God: yet not one of
them could sustain, without destruction to himself,<a id='r651'></a><a href='#f651' class='c007'><sup>[651]</sup></a> the whole
simultaneous assault of these opposing powers, unless indeed
the might of Him alone were to work in him, who said, “Be
of good cheer, I have overcome the world.”<a id='r652'></a><a href='#f652' class='c007'><sup>[652]</sup></a> And therefore
Paul exclaims with confidence, “I can do all things through
Christ, who strengtheneth me;”<a id='r653'></a><a href='#f653' class='c007'><sup>[653]</sup></a> and again, “I laboured
more abundantly than they all; yet not I, but the grace of
God which was with me.”<a id='r654'></a><a href='#f654' class='c007'><sup>[654]</sup></a> On account, then, of this power,
which certainly is not of human origin, operating and speaking
in him, Paul could say, “For I am persuaded that neither
death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor
things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor
power, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from
the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”<a id='r655'></a><a href='#f655' class='c007'><sup>[655]</sup></a> For
I do not think that human nature can alone of itself maintain
a contest with angels, and with the powers of the height
and of the abyss,<a id='r656'></a><a href='#f656' class='c007'><sup>[656]</sup></a> and with any other creature; but when it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>feels the presence of the Lord dwelling within it, confidence
in the divine help will lead it to say, “The Lord is my light,
and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the
protector of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? When the
enemies draw near to me, to eat my flesh, my enemies who
trouble me, they stumbled and fell. Though an host encamp
against me, my heart shall not fear; though war should rise
against me, in Him shall I be confident.”<a id='r657'></a><a href='#f657' class='c007'><sup>[657]</sup></a> From which I
infer that a man perhaps would never be able of himself to
vanquish an opposing power, unless he had the benefit of
divine assistance. Hence, also, the angel is said to have
wrestled with Jacob. Here, however, I understand the
writer to mean, that it was not the same thing for the angel
to have wrestled <i>with</i> Jacob, and to have wrestled <i>against</i>
him; but the angel that wrestles with him is he who was
present with him in order to secure his safety, who, after
knowing also his moral progress, gave him in addition the
name of Israel, <i>i.e.</i> he is <i>with</i> him in the struggle, and assists
him in the contest; seeing there was undoubtedly another
angel against whom he contended, and against whom he had
to carry on a contest. Finally, Paul has not said that we
wrestle <i>with</i> princes, or <i>with</i> powers, but <i>against</i> principalities
and powers. And hence, although Jacob wrestled, it was
unquestionably <i>against</i> some one of those powers which,
Paul declares, resist and contend with the human race, and
especially with the saints. And therefore at last the Scripture
says of him that “he wrestled with the angel, and had
power with God,” so that the struggle is supported by help
of the angel, but the prize of success conducts the conqueror
to God.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. Nor are we, indeed, to suppose that struggles of this
kind are carried on by the exercise of bodily strength, and of
the arts of the wrestling school;<a id='r658'></a><a href='#f658' class='c007'><sup>[658]</sup></a> but spirit contends with
spirit, according to the declaration of Paul, that our struggle
is against principalities, and powers, and the rulers of the
darkness of this world. Nay, the following is to be understood
as the nature of the struggles; when, <i>e.g.</i>, losses and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>dangers befall us, or calumnies and false accusations are
brought against us, it not being the object of the hostile
powers that we should suffer these [trials] only, but that by
means of them we should be driven either to excess of anger
or sorrow, or to the last pitch of despair; or at least, which
is a greater sin, should be forced, when fatigued and overcome
by any annoyances, to make complaints against God,
as one who does not administer human life justly and equitably;
the consequence of which is, that our faith may be
weakened, or our hopes disappointed, or we may be compelled
to give up the truth of our opinions, or be led to
entertain irreligious sentiments regarding God. For some
such things are written regarding Job, after the devil had
requested God that power should be given him over his
goods. By which also we are taught, that it is not by any
accidental attacks that we are assailed, whenever we are
visited with any such loss of property, nor that it is owing
to chance when one of us is taken prisoner, or when the
dwellings in which those who are dear to us are crushed to
death, fall in ruins; for, with respect to all these occurrences,
every believer ought to say, “Thou couldst have no power
at all against me, except it were given thee from above.”<a id='r659'></a><a href='#f659' class='c007'><sup>[659]</sup></a>
For observe that the house of Job did not fall upon his sons
until the devil had first received power against them; nor
would the horsemen have made an irruption in three bands,<a id='r660'></a><a href='#f660' class='c007'><sup>[660]</sup></a>
to carry away his camels or his oxen, and other cattle, unless
they had been instigated by that spirit to whom they had
delivered themselves up as the servants of his will. Nor
would that fire, as it seemed to be, or thunderbolt, as it has
been considered, have fallen upon the sheep of the patriarch,
until the devil had said to God, “Hast Thou not made a
hedge about all that is without and within his house, and
around all the rest of his property? But now put forth Thy
hand, and touch all that he hath, [and see] if he do not
renounce Thee to Thy face.”<a id='r661'></a><a href='#f661' class='c007'><sup>[661]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>7. The result of all the foregoing remarks is to show, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>all the occurrences in the world which are considered to be
of an intermediate kind, whether they be mournful or otherwise,
are brought about, not indeed by God, and yet not
without Him; while He not only does not prevent those
wicked and opposing powers that are desirous to bring about
these things [from accomplishing their purpose], but even
permits them to do so, although only on certain occasions
and to certain individuals, as is said with respect to Job himself,
that for a certain time he was made to fall under the
power of others, and to have his house plundered by unjust
persons. And therefore holy Scripture teaches us to receive
all that happens as sent by God, knowing that without Him
no event occurs. For how can we doubt that such is the
case, viz. that nothing comes to man without [the will of]
God, when our Lord and Saviour declares, “Are not two
sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall
on the ground without your Father who is in heaven.”<a id='r662'></a><a href='#f662' class='c007'><sup>[662]</sup></a>
But the necessity of the case has drawn us away in a
lengthened digression on the subject of the struggle waged
by the hostile powers against men, and of those sadder
events which happen to human life, <i>i.e.</i> its temptations—according
to the declaration of Job, “Is not the whole life
of man upon the earth a temptation?”<a id='r663'></a><a href='#f663' class='c007'><sup>[663]</sup></a>—in order that the
manner of their occurrence, and the spirit in which we
should regard them, might be clearly shown. Let us notice
next, how men fall away into the sin of false knowledge, or
with what object the opposing powers are wont to stir up
conflict with us regarding such things.</p>

  <h4 id='de-principiis-b3-c3' class='c010'>CHAPTER <abbr title='three'>III.</abbr> <br> ON THREEFOLD WISDOM.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c005'>1. The holy apostle, wishing to teach us some great and
hidden truth respecting science and wisdom, says, in the
first Epistle to the Corinthians: “We speak wisdom among
them that are perfect; yet not the wisdom of this world, nor
of the princes of the world, that come to nought: but we
speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden
wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:
which none of the princes of the world knew: for had they
known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.”<a id='r664'></a><a href='#f664' class='c007'><sup>[664]</sup></a>
In this passage, wishing to describe the different kinds of
wisdom, he points out that there is a wisdom of this world,
and a wisdom of the princes of this world, and another
wisdom of God. But when he uses the expression “wisdom
of the princes of this world,” I do not think that he means a
wisdom common to all the princes of this world, but one
rather that is peculiar to certain individuals among them.
And again, when he says, “We speak the wisdom of God
in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained
before the world unto our glory,”<a id='r665'></a><a href='#f665' class='c007'><sup>[665]</sup></a> we must inquire whether
his meaning be, that this is the same wisdom of God which
was hidden from other times and generations, and was not
made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed
to His holy apostles and prophets, and which was also that
wisdom of God before the advent of the Saviour, by means
of which Solomon obtained his wisdom, and in reference to
which the language of the Saviour Himself declared, that
what He taught was greater than Solomon, in these words,
“Behold, a greater than Solomon is here,”<a id='r666'></a><a href='#f666' class='c007'><sup>[666]</sup></a>—words which
show, that those who were instructed by the Saviour were
instructed in something higher than the knowledge of Solomon.
For if one were to assert that the Saviour did indeed
Himself possess greater knowledge, but did not communicate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>more to others than Solomon did, how will that agree with
the statement which follows: “The queen of the south shall
rise up in the judgment, and condemn the men of this
generation, because she came from the ends of the earth to
hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than
Solomon is here?”<a id='r667'></a><a href='#f667' class='c007'><sup>[667]</sup></a> There is therefore a wisdom of this
world, and also probably a wisdom belonging to each individual
prince of this world. But with respect to the wisdom
of God alone, we perceive that this is indicated, that it
operated to a less degree in ancient and former times, and
was [afterwards] more fully revealed and manifested through
Christ. We shall inquire, however, regarding the wisdom of
God in the proper place.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. But now, since we are treating of the manner in which
the opposing powers stir up those contests, by means of
which false knowledge is introduced into the minds of men,
and human souls led astray, while they imagine that they
have discovered wisdom, I think it necessary to name and
distinguish the wisdom of this world, and of the princes of
this world, that by so doing we may discover who are the
fathers of this wisdom, nay, even of these kinds of wisdom.<a id='r668'></a><a href='#f668' class='c007'><sup>[668]</sup></a>
I am of opinion, therefore, as I have stated above, that there
is another wisdom of this world besides those [different kinds
of] wisdom<a id='r669'></a><a href='#f669' class='c007'><sup>[669]</sup></a> which belong to the princes of this world, by
which wisdom those things seem to be understood and comprehended
which belong to this world. This wisdom, however,
possesses in itself no fitness for forming any opinion
either respecting divine things,<a id='r670'></a><a href='#f670' class='c007'><sup>[670]</sup></a> or the plan of the world’s
government, or any other subjects of importance, or regarding
the training for a good or happy life; but is such as deals
wholly with the art of poetry, <i>e.g.</i>, or that of grammar, or
rhetoric, or geometry, or music, with which also, perhaps,
medicine should be classed. In all these subjects we are to
suppose that the wisdom of this world is included. The
wisdom of the princes of this world, on the other hand,
we understand to be such as the secret and occult philosophy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>as they call it, of the Egyptians, and the astrology
of the Chaldeans and Indians, who make profession of the
knowledge of high things,<a id='r671'></a><a href='#f671' class='c007'><sup>[671]</sup></a> and also that manifold variety of
opinion which prevails among the Greeks regarding divine
things. Accordingly, in the holy Scriptures we find that
there are princes over individual nations; as in Daniel<a id='r672'></a><a href='#f672' class='c007'><sup>[672]</sup></a> we
read that there was a prince of the kingdom of Persia, and
another prince of the kingdom of Græcia, who are clearly
shown, by the nature of the passage, to be not human beings,
but certain powers. In the prophecies of Ezekiel,<a id='r673'></a><a href='#f673' class='c007'><sup>[673]</sup></a> also, the
prince of Tyre is unmistakeably shown to be a kind of spiritual
power. When these, then, and others of the same kind,
possessing each his own wisdom, and building up his own
opinions and sentiments, beheld our Lord and Saviour professing
and declaring that He had for this purpose come into
the world, that all the opinions of science, falsely so called,
might be destroyed, not knowing what was concealed within
Him, they forthwith laid a snare for Him: for “the kings of
the earth set themselves, and the rulers assembled together,
against the Lord and His Christ.”<a id='r674'></a><a href='#f674' class='c007'><sup>[674]</sup></a> But their snares being
discovered, and the plans which they had attempted to carry
out being made manifest when they crucified the Lord of glory,
therefore the apostle says, “We speak wisdom among them
that are perfect, but not the wisdom of this world, nor of the
princes of this world, who are brought to nought, which none
of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it,
they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.”<a id='r675'></a><a href='#f675' class='c007'><sup>[675]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>3. We must, indeed, endeavour to ascertain whether that
wisdom<a id='r676'></a><a href='#f676' class='c007'><sup>[676]</sup></a> of the princes of this world, with which they endeavour
to imbue men, is introduced into their minds by the
opposing powers, with the purpose of ensnaring and injuring
them, or only for the purpose of deceiving them, <i>i.e.</i> not with
the object of doing any hurt to man; but, as these princes
of this world esteem such opinions to be true, they desire to
impart to others what they themselves believe to be the truth:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>and this is the view which I am inclined to adopt. For as, to
take an illustration, certain Greek authors, or the leaders of
some heretical sect, after having imbibed an error in doctrine
instead of the truth, and having come to the conclusion in
their own minds that such is the truth, proceed, in the next
place, to endeavour to persuade others of the correctness of
their opinions; so, in like manner, are we to suppose is the
procedure of the princes of this world, in which to certain
spiritual powers has been assigned the rule over certain
nations, and who are termed on that account the princes of
this world. There are besides, in addition to these princes,
certain special energies<a id='r677'></a><a href='#f677' class='c007'><sup>[677]</sup></a> of this world, <i>i.e.</i> spiritual powers,
which bring about certain effects, which they have themselves,
in virtue of their freedom of will, chosen to produce, and to
these belong those princes who practise the wisdom of this
world: there being, for example, a peculiar energy and
power, which is the inspirer of poetry; another, of geometry;
and so a separate power, to remind us of each of the arts and
professions of this kind. Lastly, many Greek writers have
been of opinion that the art of poetry cannot exist without
madness;<a id='r678'></a><a href='#f678' class='c007'><sup>[678]</sup></a> whence also it is several times related in their
histories, that those whom they call poets<a id='r679'></a><a href='#f679' class='c007'><sup>[679]</sup></a> were suddenly
filled with a kind of spirit of madness. And what are we to
say also of those whom they call diviners,<a id='r680'></a><a href='#f680' class='c007'><sup>[680]</sup></a> from whom, by
the working of those demons who have the mastery over
them, answers are given in carefully constructed verses?
Those persons, too, whom they term Magi or Malevolent,<a id='r681'></a><a href='#f681' class='c007'><sup>[681]</sup></a>
frequently, by invoking demons over boys of tender years,
have made them repeat poetical compositions which were
the admiration and amazement of all. Now these effects we
are to suppose are brought about in the following manner:
As holy and immaculate souls, after devoting themselves
to God with all affection and purity, and after preserving
themselves free from all contagion of evil spirits,<a id='r682'></a><a href='#f682' class='c007'><sup>[682]</sup></a> and after
being purified by lengthened abstinence, and imbued with
holy and religious training, assume by this means a portion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>of divinity, and earn the grace of prophecy, and other divine
gifts; so also are we to suppose that those who place themselves
in the way of the opposing powers, <i>i.e.</i> who purposely
admire and adopt their manner of life and habits,<a id='r683'></a><a href='#f683' class='c007'><sup>[683]</sup></a> receive
their inspiration, and become partakers of their wisdom and
doctrine. And the result of this is, that they are filled with
the working of those spirits to whose service they have subjected
themselves.</p>

<p class='c006'>4, With respect to those, indeed, who teach differently
regarding Christ from what the rule of Scripture allows, it
is no idle task to ascertain whether it is from a treacherous
purpose that these opposing powers, in their struggles to prevent
a belief in Christ, have devised certain fabulous and
impious doctrines; or whether, on hearing the word of Christ,
and not being able to cast it forth from the secrecy of their
conscience, nor yet to retain it pure and holy, they have, by
means of vessels that were convenient to their use,<a id='r684'></a><a href='#f684' class='c007'><sup>[684]</sup></a> and, so to
speak, through their prophets, introduced various errors contrary
to the rule of Christian truth. Now we are to suppose
rather that apostate and refugee powers,<a id='r685'></a><a href='#f685' class='c007'><sup>[685]</sup></a> which have departed
from God out of the very wickedness of their mind and
will,<a id='r686'></a><a href='#f686' class='c007'><sup>[686]</sup></a> or from envy of those for whom there is prepared (on
their becoming acquainted with the truth) an ascent to the
same rank, whence they themselves had fallen, did, in order
to prevent any progress of that kind, invent these errors and
delusions of false doctrine. It is then clearly established, by
many proofs, that while the soul of man exists in this body,
it may admit different energies, <i>i.e.</i> operations, from a diversity
of good and evil spirits. Now, of wicked spirits there
is a twofold mode of operation: <i>i.e.</i> when they either take
complete and entire possession of the mind,<a id='r687'></a><a href='#f687' class='c007'><sup>[687]</sup></a> so as to allow
their captives<a id='r688'></a><a href='#f688' class='c007'><sup>[688]</sup></a> the power neither of understanding nor feeling;
as, for instance, is the case with those commonly called
possessed,<a id='r689'></a><a href='#f689' class='c007'><sup>[689]</sup></a> whom we see to be deprived of reason, and insane
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>(such as those were who are related in the Gospel to have
been cured by the Saviour); or when by their wicked suggestions
they deprave a sentient and intelligent soul with
thoughts of various kinds, persuading it to evil, of which
Judas is an illustration, who was induced at the suggestion
of the devil to commit the crime of treason, according to the
declaration of Scripture, that “the devil had already put it
into the heart of Judas Iscariot to betray Him.”<a id='r690'></a><a href='#f690' class='c007'><sup>[690]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>But a man receives the energy, <i>i.e.</i> the working, of a good
spirit, when he is stirred and incited to good, and is inspired
to heavenly or divine things; as the holy angels and God
Himself wrought in the prophets, arousing and exhorting
them by their holy suggestions to a better course of life,
yet so, indeed, that it remained within the will and judgment
of the individual, either to be willing or unwilling to follow
the call to divine and heavenly things. And from this
manifest distinction, it is seen how the soul is moved by the
presence of a better spirit, <i>i.e.</i> if it encounter no perturbation
or alienation of mind whatever from the impending
inspiration, nor lose the free control of its will; as, for
instance, is the case with all, whether prophets or apostles,
who ministered to the divine responses without any perturbation
of mind. Now, that by the suggestions of a good
spirit the memory of man is aroused to the recollection of
better things, we have already shown by previous instances,
when we mentioned the cases of Mordecai and Artaxerxes.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. This too, I think, should next be inquired into, viz.
what are the reasons why a human soul is acted on at one
time by good [spirits], and at another by bad: the grounds
of which I suspect to be older than the bodily birth of the
individual, as John [the Baptist] showed by his leaping and
exulting in his mother’s womb, when the voice of the salutation
of Mary reached the ears of his mother Elisabeth; and
as Jeremiah the prophet declares, who was known to God
before he was formed in his mother’s womb, and before he
was born was sanctified by Him, and while yet a boy received
the grace of prophecy.<a id='r691'></a><a href='#f691' class='c007'><sup>[691]</sup></a> And again, on the other hand, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>is shown beyond a doubt, that some have been possessed by
hostile spirits from the very beginning of their lives: <i>i.e.</i>,
some were born with an evil spirit; and others, according to
credible histories, have practised divination<a id='r692'></a><a href='#f692' class='c007'><sup>[692]</sup></a> from childhood.
Others have been under the influence of the demon called
Python, <i>i.e.</i> the ventriloquial spirit, from the commencement
of their existence. To all which instances, those who
maintain that everything in the world is under the administration
of divine providence (as is also our own belief), can,
as it appears to me, give no other answer, so as to show that
no shadow of injustice rests upon the divine government,
than by holding that there were certain causes of prior existence,
in consequence of which the souls, before their birth in
the body, contracted a certain amount of guilt in their sensitive
nature, or in their movements, on account of which they
have been judged worthy by Divine Providence of being
placed in this condition. For a soul is always in possession
of free-will, as well when it is in the body as when it is
without it; and freedom of will is always directed either to
good or evil. Nor can any rational and sentient being, <i>i.e.</i>
a mind or soul, exist without some movement either good
or bad. And it is probable that these movements furnish
grounds for merit even before they do anything in this
world; so that on account of these merits or grounds they
are, immediately on their birth, and even before it, so to
speak, assorted by Divine Providence for the endurance
either of good or evil.</p>

<p class='c006'>Let such, then, be our views respecting those events which
appear to befall men, either immediately after birth, or even
before they enter upon the light. But as regards the suggestions
which are made to the soul, <i>i.e.</i> to the faculty of
human thought, by different spirits, and which arouse men to
good actions or the contrary, even in such a case we must
suppose that there sometimes existed certain causes anterior
to bodily birth. For occasionally the mind, when watchful,
and casting away from it what is evil, calls to itself the aid of
the good; or if it be, on the contrary, negligent and slothful,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>it makes room through insufficient caution for these spirits,
which, lying in wait secretly like robbers, contrive to rush
into the minds of men when they see a lodgment made for
them by sloth; as the Apostle Peter says, “that our adversary
the devil goes about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may
devour.”<a id='r693'></a><a href='#f693' class='c007'><sup>[693]</sup></a> On which account our heart must be kept with
all carefulness both by day and night, and no place be given
to the devil; but every effort must be used that the ministers
of God—those spirits, viz., who were sent to minister to them
who are called to be heirs of salvation<a id='r694'></a><a href='#f694' class='c007'><sup>[694]</sup></a>—may find a place
within us, and be delighted to enter into the guest-chamber<a id='r695'></a><a href='#f695' class='c007'><sup>[695]</sup></a>
of our soul, and dwelling within us may guide us by their
counsels; if, indeed, they shall find the habitation of our
heart adorned by the practice of virtue and holiness. But
let that be sufficient which we have said, as we best could,
regarding those powers which are hostile to the human race.</p>

<h4 id='de-principiis-b3-c4' class='c010'>CHAPTER <abbr title='four'>IV.</abbr> <br> ON HUMAN TEMPTATIONS.</h4>
<p class='c005'>1. And now the subject of human temptations must not,
in my opinion, be passed over in silence, which take their rise
sometimes from flesh and blood, or from the wisdom of flesh
and blood, which is said to be hostile to God. And whether
the statement be true which certain allege, viz. that each
individual has as it were two souls, we shall determine after
we have explained the nature of those temptations, which are
said to be more powerful than any of human origin, <i>i.e.</i> which
we sustain from principalities and powers, and from the rulers
of the darkness of this world, and from spiritual wickedness
in high places, or to which we are subjected from wicked
spirits and unclean demons. Now, in the investigation of this
subject, we must, I think, inquire according to a logical
method whether there be in us human beings, who are composed
of soul and body and vital spirit, some other element,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>possessing an incitement of its own, and evoking a movement
towards evil. For a question of this kind is wont to be discussed
by some in this way: whether, viz., as two souls are
said to co-exist within us, the one is more divine and heavenly
and the other inferior; or whether, from the very fact that
we inhere in bodily structures which according to their own
proper nature are dead, and altogether devoid of life (seeing
it is from us, <i>i.e.</i> from our souls, that the material body derives
its life, it being contrary and hostile to the spirit), we are drawn
on and enticed to the practice of those evils which are agreeable
to the body; or whether, thirdly (which was the opinion
of some of the Greek philosophers), although our soul is one
in substance, it nevertheless consists of several elements, and
one portion of it is called rational and another irrational, and
that which is termed the irrational part is again separated
into two affections—those of covetousness and passion. These
three opinions, then, regarding the soul, which we have stated
above, we have found to be entertained by some, but that one
of them, which we have mentioned as being adopted by certain
Grecian philosophers, viz. that the soul is tripartite, I do
not observe to be greatly confirmed by the authority of holy
Scripture; while with respect to the remaining two there is
found a considerable number of passages in the holy Scriptures
which seem capable of application to them.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Now, of these opinions, let us first discuss that which is
maintained by some, that there is in us a good and heavenly
soul, and another earthly and inferior; and that the better
soul is implanted within us from heaven, such as was that
which, while Jacob was still in the womb, gave him the prize
of victory in supplanting his brother Esau, and which in
the case of Jeremiah was sanctified from his birth, and in
that of John was filled by the Holy Spirit from the womb.
Now, that which they term the inferior soul is produced, they
allege, along with the body itself out of the seed of the body,
whence they say it cannot live or subsist beyond the body,
on which account also they say it is frequently termed flesh.
For the expression, “The flesh lusteth against the spirit,”<a id='r696'></a><a href='#f696' class='c007'><sup>[696]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>they take to be applicable not to the flesh, but to this soul,
which is properly the soul of the flesh. From these words,
moreover, they endeavour notwithstanding to make good the
declaration in Leviticus: “The life of all flesh is the blood
thereof.”<a id='r697'></a><a href='#f697' class='c007'><sup>[697]</sup></a> For, from the circumstance that it is the diffusion
of the blood throughout the whole flesh which produces life
in the flesh, they assert that this soul, which is said to be the
life of all flesh, is contained in the blood. This statement,
moreover, that the flesh struggles against the spirit, and the
spirit against the flesh; and the further statement, that “the
life of all flesh is the blood thereof,” is, according to these
writers, simply calling the wisdom of the flesh by another
name, because it is a kind of material spirit, which is not
subject to the law of God, nor can be so, because it has
earthly wishes and bodily desires. And it is with respect to
this that they think the apostle uttered the words: “I see
another law in my members, warring against the law of my
mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which
is in my members.”<a id='r698'></a><a href='#f698' class='c007'><sup>[698]</sup></a> And if one were to object to them that
these words were spoken of the nature of the body, which
indeed, agreeably to the peculiarity of its nature, is dead, but
is said to have sensibility, or wisdom,<a id='r699'></a><a href='#f699' class='c007'><sup>[699]</sup></a> which is hostile to God,
or which struggles against the spirit; or if one were to say
that, in a certain degree, the flesh itself was possessed of a
voice, which should cry out against the endurance of hunger,
or thirst, or cold, or of any discomfort arising either from
abundance or poverty,—they would endeavour to weaken and
impair the force of such [arguments], by showing that there
were many other mental perturbations<a id='r700'></a><a href='#f700' class='c007'><sup>[700]</sup></a> which derive their
origin in no respect from the flesh, and yet against which the
spirit struggles, such as ambition, avarice, emulation, envy,
pride, and others like these; and seeing that with these the
human mind or spirit wages a kind of contest, they lay down
as the cause of all these evils, nothing else than this corporal
soul, as it were, of which we have spoken above, and which
is generated from the seed by a process of traducianism.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>They are accustomed also to adduce, in support of their
assertion, the declaration of the apostle, “Now the works of
the flesh are manifest, which are these, fornication, uncleanness,
lasciviousness, idolatry, poisonings,<a id='r701'></a><a href='#f701' class='c007'><sup>[701]</sup></a> hatred, contentions,
emulations, wrath, quarrelling, dissensions, heresies, sects,
envyings, drunkenness, revellings, and the like;”<a id='r702'></a><a href='#f702' class='c007'><sup>[702]</sup></a> asserting
that all these do not derive their origin from the habits or
pleasures of the flesh, so that all such movements are to be
regarded as inherent in that substance which has not a soul,
<i>i.e.</i> the flesh. The declaration, moreover, “For ye see your
calling, brethren, how that not many wise men among you
according to the flesh are called,”<a id='r703'></a><a href='#f703' class='c007'><sup>[703]</sup></a> would seem to require to
be understood as if there were one kind of wisdom, carnal
and material, and another according to the spirit, the former
of which cannot indeed be called wisdom, unless there be a
soul of the flesh, which is wise in respect of what is called
carnal wisdom. And in addition to these passages they adduce
the following: “Since the flesh lusteth against the spirit,
and the spirit against the flesh, so that we cannot do the
things that we would.”<a id='r704'></a><a href='#f704' class='c007'><sup>[704]</sup></a> What are these things now respecting
which he says, “that we cannot do the things that we
would?” It is certain, they reply, that the spirit cannot be
intended; for the will of the spirit suffers no hindrance. But
neither can the flesh be meant, because if it has not a soul of
its own, neither can it assuredly possess a will. It remains,
then, that the will of this soul be intended which is capable
of having a will of its own, and which certainly is opposed to
the will of the spirit. And if this be the case, it is established
that the will of the soul is something intermediate between
the flesh and the spirit, undoubtedly obeying and serving that
one of the two which it has elected to obey. And if it yield
itself up to the pleasures of the flesh, it renders men carnal;
but when it unites itself with the spirit, it produces men of
the spirit, and who on that account are termed spiritual. And
this seems to be the meaning of the apostle in the words,
“But ye are not in the flesh, but in the spirit.”<a id='r705'></a><a href='#f705' class='c007'><sup>[705]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>We have accordingly to ascertain what is this very will
[intermediate] between flesh and spirit, besides that will
which is said to belong to the flesh or the spirit. For it is
held as certain, that everything which is said to be a work of
the spirit is [a product of] the will of the spirit, and everything
that is called a work of the flesh [proceeds from] the
will of the flesh. What else then, besides these, is that will
of the soul which receives a separate name,<a id='r706'></a><a href='#f706' class='c007'><sup>[706]</sup></a> and which will,
the apostle being opposed to our executing, says: “Ye cannot
do the things that ye would?” By this it would seem
to be intended, that it ought to adhere to neither of these
two, <i>i.e.</i> to neither flesh nor spirit. But some one will say,
that as it is better for the soul to execute its own will than
that of the flesh; so, on the other hand, it is better to do the
will of the spirit than its own will. How, then, does the
apostle say, “that ye cannot do the things that ye would?”
Because in that contest which is waged between flesh and
spirit, the spirit is by no means certain of victory, it being
manifest that in very many individuals the flesh has the
mastery.</p>

<p class='c006'>But since the subject of discussion on which we have
entered is one of great profundity, which it is necessary to
consider in all its bearings,<a id='r707'></a><a href='#f707' class='c007'><sup>[707]</sup></a> let us see whether some such
point as this may not be determined: that as it is better for
the soul to follow the spirit when the latter has overcome
the flesh, so also, if it seem to be a worse course for the
former to follow the flesh in its struggles against the spirit,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>when the latter would recall the soul to its influence, it may
nevertheless appear a more advantageous procedure for the
soul to be under the mastery of the flesh than to remain
under the power of its own will. For, since it is said to be
neither hot nor cold, but to continue in a sort of tepid condition,
it will find conversion a slow and somewhat difficult
undertaking. If indeed it clung to the flesh, then, satiated
at length, and filled with those very evils which it suffers
from the vices of the flesh, and wearied as it were by the
heavy burdens of luxury and lust, it may sometimes be converted
with greater ease and rapidity from the filthiness of
matter to a desire for heavenly things, and [to a taste for]
spiritual graces. And the apostle must be supposed to have
said, that “the spirit contends against the flesh, and the flesh
against the spirit, so that we cannot do the things that we
would” (those things, undoubtedly, which are designated as
being beyond the will of the spirit, and the will of the flesh),
meaning (as if we were to express it in other words) that it is
better for a man to be either in a state of virtue or in one of
wickedness, than in neither of these; but that the soul, before
its conversion to the spirit, and its union with it,<a id='r708'></a><a href='#f708' class='c007'><sup>[708]</sup></a> appears
during its adherence to the body, and its meditation of carnal
things, to be neither in a good condition nor in a manifestly
bad one, but resembles, so to speak, an animal. It is better,
however, for it, if possible, to be rendered spiritual through
adherence to the spirit; but if that cannot be done, it is
more expedient for it to follow even the wickedness of the
flesh, than, placed under the influence of its own will, to retain
the position of an irrational animal.</p>

<p class='c006'>These points we have now discussed, in our desire to consider
each individual opinion, at greater length than we
intended, that those views might not be supposed to have
escaped our notice which are generally brought forward by
those who inquire whether there is within us any other soul
than this heavenly and rational one, which is naturally
opposed to the latter, and is called either the flesh, or the
wisdom of the flesh, or the soul of the flesh.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>4. Let us now see what answer is usually returned to
these statements by those who maintain that there is in us
one movement, and one life, proceeding from one and the
same soul, both the salvation and the destruction of which are
ascribed to itself as a result of its own actions. And, in the
first place, let us notice of what nature those commotions<a id='r709'></a><a href='#f709' class='c007'><sup>[709]</sup></a>
of the soul are which we suffer, when we feel ourselves inwardly
drawn in different directions; when there arises a
kind of contest of thoughts in our hearts, and certain probabilities
are suggested us, agreeably to which we lean now
to this side, now to that, and by which we are sometimes
convicted of error, and sometimes approve of our acts.<a id='r710'></a><a href='#f710' class='c007'><sup>[710]</sup></a> It
is nothing remarkable, however, to say of wicked spirits, that
they have a varying and conflicting judgment, and one out
of harmony with itself, since such is found to be the case
in all men, whenever, in deliberating upon an uncertain
event, counsel is taken, and men consider and consult what
is to be chosen as the better and more useful course. It is
not therefore surprising that, if two probabilities meet, and
suggest opposite views, they should drag the mind in contrary
directions. For example, if a man be led by reflection
to believe and to fear God, it cannot then be said that the
flesh contends against the spirit; but, amidst the uncertainty
of what may be true and advantageous, the mind is drawn in
opposite directions. So, also, when it is supposed that the
flesh provokes to the indulgence of lust, but better counsels
oppose allurements of that kind, we are not to suppose that
it is one life which is resisting another, but that it is the
tendency of the nature of the body, which is eager to empty
out and cleanse the places filled with seminal moisture; as,
in like manner, it is not to be supposed that it is any opposing
power, or the life of another soul, which excites within
us the appetite of thirst, and impels us to drink, or which
causes us to feel hunger, and drives us to satisfy it. But as
it is by the natural movements of the body that food and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>drink are either desired or rejected,<a id='r711'></a><a href='#f711' class='c007'><sup>[711]</sup></a> so also the natural seed,
collected together in course of time in the various vessels, has
an eager desire to be expelled and thrown away, and is so far
from never being removed, save by the impulse of some exciting
cause, that it is even sometimes spontaneously emitted.
When, therefore, it is said that “the flesh struggles against
the spirit,” these persons understand the expression to mean
that habit or necessity, or the delights of the flesh, arouse a
man, and withdraw him from divine and spiritual things.
For, owing to the necessity of the body being drawn away,
we are not allowed to have leisure for divine things, which
are to be eternally advantageous. So again, the soul, devoting
itself to divine and spiritual pursuits, and being united to
the spirit, is said to fight against the flesh, by not permitting
it to be relaxed by indulgence, and to become unsteady
through the influence of those pleasures for which it feels a
natural delight. In this way, also, they claim to understand
the words, “The wisdom of the flesh is hostile to God,”<a id='r712'></a><a href='#f712' class='c007'><sup>[712]</sup></a> not
that the flesh really has a soul, or a wisdom of its own. But
as we are accustomed to say, by an abuse<a id='r713'></a><a href='#f713' class='c007'><sup>[713]</sup></a> of language, that
the earth is thirsty, and wishes to drink in water, this use of
the word “wishes” is not proper, but catachrestic,—as if we
were to say again, that this house wants to be rebuilt,<a id='r714'></a><a href='#f714' class='c007'><sup>[714]</sup></a> and
many other similar expressions; so also is the wisdom of the
flesh to be understood, or the expression, that “the flesh
lusteth against the spirit.” They generally connect with these
the expression, “The voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto
me from the ground.”<a id='r715'></a><a href='#f715' class='c007'><sup>[715]</sup></a> For what cries unto the Lord is
not properly the blood which was shed; but the blood is said
improperly to cry out, vengeance being demanded upon him
who had shed it. The declaration also of the apostle, “I
see another law in my members, warring against the law
of my mind,”<a id='r716'></a><a href='#f716' class='c007'><sup>[716]</sup></a> they so understand as if he had said, That
he who wishes to devote himself to the word of God is, on
account of his bodily necessities and habits, which like a sort
of law are ingrained in the body, distracted, and divided,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>and impeded, lest, by devoting himself vigorously to the
study of wisdom, he should be enabled to behold the divine
mysteries.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. With respect, however, to the following being ranked
among the works of the flesh, viz. heresies, and envyings,
and contentions, or other [vices], they so understand the
passage, that the mind, being rendered grosser in feeling,
from its yielding itself to the passions of the body, and being
oppressed by the mass of its vices, and having no refined or
spiritual feelings, is said to be made flesh, and derives its
name from that in which it exhibits more vigour and force
of will.<a id='r717'></a><a href='#f717' class='c007'><sup>[717]</sup></a> They also make this further inquiry, “Who will
be found, or who will be said to be, the creator of this evil
sense, called the sense of the flesh?” Because they defend
the opinion that there is no other creator of soul and flesh
than God. And if we were to assert that the good God
created anything in His own creation that was hostile to
Himself, it would appear to be a manifest absurdity. If,
then, it is written, that “carnal wisdom is enmity against
God,”<a id='r718'></a><a href='#f718' class='c007'><sup>[718]</sup></a> and if this be declared to be a result of creation, God
Himself will appear to have formed a nature hostile to Himself,
which cannot be subject to Him nor to His law, as if it
were [supposed to be] an animal of which such qualities are
predicated. And if this view be admitted, in what respect
will it appear to differ from that of those who maintain that
souls of different natures are created, which, according to
their natures,<a id='r719'></a><a href='#f719' class='c007'><sup>[719]</sup></a> are destined either to be lost or saved? But
this is an opinion of the heretics alone, who, not being able
to maintain the justice of God on grounds of piety, compose
impious inventions of this kind. And now we have brought
forward to the best of our ability, in the person of each of
the parties, what might be advanced by way of argument
regarding the several views, and let the reader choose out of
them for himself that which he thinks ought to be preferred.</p>

  <h4 id='de-principiis-b3-c5' class='c010'>CHAPTER <abbr title='five'>V.</abbr> <br> THAT THE WORLD TOOK ITS BEGINNING IN TIME.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c005'>1. And now, since there is one of the articles of the
church<a id='r720'></a><a href='#f720' class='c007'><sup>[720]</sup></a> which is held principally in consequence of our
belief in the truth of our sacred history, viz. that this world
was created and took its beginning at a certain time, and, in
conformity to the cycle of time<a id='r721'></a><a href='#f721' class='c007'><sup>[721]</sup></a> decreed to all things, is to
be destroyed on account of its corruption, there seems no
absurdity in re-discussing a few points connected with this
subject. And so far, indeed, as the credibility of Scripture
is concerned, the declarations on such a matter seem easy of
proof. Even the heretics, although widely opposed on many
other things, yet on this appear to be at one, yielding to the
authority of Scripture.</p>

<p class='c006'>Concerning, then, the creation of the world, what portion
of Scripture can give us more information regarding it,
than the account which Moses has transmitted respecting
its origin? And although it comprehends matters of profounder
significance than the mere historical narrative appears
to indicate, and contains very many things that are to
be spiritually understood, and employs the letter, as a kind
of veil, in treating of profound and mystical subjects; nevertheless
the language of the narrator shows that all visible
things were created at a certain time. But with regard to
the consummation of the world, Jacob is the first who gives
any information, in addressing his children in the words:
“Gather yourselves together unto me, ye sons of Jacob,
that I may tell you what shall be in the last days,” or
“after the last days.”<a id='r722'></a><a href='#f722' class='c007'><sup>[722]</sup></a> If, then, there be “last days,” or a
period “succeeding the last days,” the days which had a
beginning must necessarily come to an end. David, too,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>declares: “The heavens shall perish, but Thou shalt endure;
yea, all of them shall wax old as doth a garment: as a vesture
shalt Thou change them, and they shall be changed: but
Thou art the same, and Thy years shall have no end.”<a id='r723'></a><a href='#f723' class='c007'><sup>[723]</sup></a> Our
Lord and Saviour, indeed, in the words, “He who made
them at the beginning, made them male and female,”<a id='r724'></a><a href='#f724' class='c007'><sup>[724]</sup></a> Himself
bears witness that the world was created; and again,
when He says, “Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my
words shall not pass away,”<a id='r725'></a><a href='#f725' class='c007'><sup>[725]</sup></a> He points out that they are
perishable, and must come to an end. The apostle, moreover,
in declaring that “the creature was made subject to
vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected
the same in hope, because the creature itself also shall
be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious
liberty of the children of God,”<a id='r726'></a><a href='#f726' class='c007'><sup>[726]</sup></a> manifestly announces the
end of the world; as he does also when he again says, “The
fashion of this world passeth away.”<a id='r727'></a><a href='#f727' class='c007'><sup>[727]</sup></a> Now, by the expression
which he employs, “that the creature was made subject
to vanity,” he shows that there was a beginning to this world:
for if the creature were made subject to vanity on account
of some hope, it was certainly made subject from a cause;
and seeing it was from a cause, it must necessarily have had
a beginning: for, without some beginning, the creature could
not be subject to vanity, nor could that [creature] hope to
be freed from the bondage of corruption, which had not
begun to serve. But any one who chooses to search at his
leisure, will find numerous other passages in holy Scripture
in which the world is both said to have a beginning and to
hope for an end.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Now, if there be any one who would here oppose either
the authority or credibility of our Scriptures,<a id='r728'></a><a href='#f728' class='c007'><sup>[728]</sup></a> we would ask
of him whether he asserts that God can, or cannot, comprehend
all things? To assert that He cannot, would manifestly
be an act of impiety. If then he answer, as he must,
that God comprehends all things, it follows from the very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>fact of their being capable of comprehension, that they are
understood to have a beginning and an end, seeing that which
is altogether without any beginning cannot be at all comprehended.
For however far understanding may extend, so
far is the faculty of comprehending illimitably withdrawn
and removed when there is held to be no beginning.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. But this is the objection which they generally raise:
they say, “If the world had its beginning in time, what was
God doing before the world began? For it is at once impious
and absurd to say that the nature of God is inactive and
immoveable, or to suppose that goodness at one time did not
do good, and omnipotence at one time did not exercise its
power.” Such is the objection which they are accustomed to
make to our statement that this world had its beginning at a
certain time, and that, agreeably to our belief in Scripture,
we can calculate the years of its past duration. To these
propositions I consider that none of the heretics can easily
return an answer that will be in conformity with the nature
of their opinions. But we can give a logical answer in
accordance with the standard of religion,<a id='r729'></a><a href='#f729' class='c007'><sup>[729]</sup></a> when we say that
not then for the first time did God begin to work when He
made this visible world; but as, after its destruction, there
will be another world, so also we believe that others existed
before the present came into being. And both of these positions
will be confirmed by the authority of holy Scripture.
For that there will be another world after this, is taught by
Isaiah, who says, “There will be a new heavens, and a new
earth, which I shall make to abide in my sight, saith the
Lord;”<a id='r730'></a><a href='#f730' class='c007'><sup>[730]</sup></a> and that before this world others also existed is
shown by Ecclesiastes, in the words: “What is that which
hath been? Even that which shall be. And what is that
which has been created? Even this which is to be created:
and there is nothing altogether new under the sun. Who
shall speak and declare, Lo, this is new? It hath already
been in the ages which have been before us.”<a id='r731'></a><a href='#f731' class='c007'><sup>[731]</sup></a> By these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>testimonies it is established both that there were ages<a id='r732'></a><a href='#f732' class='c007'><sup>[732]</sup></a> before
our own, and that there will be others after it. It is not,
however, to be supposed that several worlds existed at once,
but that, after the end of this present world, others will take
their beginning; respecting which it is unnecessary to repeat
each particular statement, seeing we have already done so in
the preceding pages.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. This point, indeed, is not to be idly passed by, that the
holy Scriptures have called the creation of the world by a
new and peculiar name, terming it <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καταβολή</span>, which has been
very improperly translated into Latin by <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“constitutio;”</span> for
in Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καταβολή</span> signifies rather <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“dejicere,”</span> <i>i.e.</i> to cast
downwards,—a word which has been, as we have already
remarked, improperly translated into Latin by the phrase
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“constitutio mundi,”</span> as in the Gospel according to John,
where the Saviour says, “And there will be tribulation in
those days, such as was not since the beginning of the world;”<a id='r733'></a><a href='#f733' class='c007'><sup>[733]</sup></a>
in which passage <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καταβολή</span> is rendered by beginning (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>constitutio</i></span>),
which is to be understood as above explained. The
apostle also, in the Epistle to the Ephesians, has employed
the same language, saying, “Who hath chosen us before the
foundation of the world;”<a id='r734'></a><a href='#f734' class='c007'><sup>[734]</sup></a> and this foundation he calls <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καταβολή</span>,
to be understood in the same sense as before. It seems
worth while, then, to inquire what is meant by this new term;
and I am, indeed, of opinion<a id='r735'></a><a href='#f735' class='c007'><sup>[735]</sup></a> that, as the end and consummation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>of the saints will be in those [ages] which are not
seen, and are eternal, we must conclude (as frequently pointed
out in the preceding pages), from a contemplation of that
very end, that rational creatures had also a similar beginning.
And if they had a beginning such as the end for which they
hope, they existed undoubtedly from the very beginning in
those [ages] which are not seen, and are eternal. And if this
is so, then there has been a descent from a higher to a lower
condition, on the part not only of those souls who have
deserved the change by the variety of their movements, but
also on that of those who, in order to serve the whole world,
were brought down from those higher and invisible spheres
to these lower and visible ones, although against their will—“Because
the creature was subjected to vanity, not willingly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>but because of him who subjected the same in hope;”<a id='r736'></a><a href='#f736' class='c007'><sup>[736]</sup></a> so
that both sun, and moon, and stars, and angels might discharge
their duty to the world, and to those souls which, on
account of their excessive mental defects, stood in need of
bodies of a grosser and more solid nature; and for the sake of
those for whom this arrangement was necessary, this visible
world was also called into being. From this it follows, that
by the use of the word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καταβολή</span>, a descent from a higher to
a lower condition, shared by all in common, would seem to
be pointed out. The hope indeed of freedom is entertained
by the whole of creation—of being liberated from the corruption
of slavery—when the sons of God, who either fell away
or were scattered abroad,<a id='r737'></a><a href='#f737' class='c007'><sup>[737]</sup></a> shall be gathered together into
one, or when they shall have fulfilled their other duties in
this world, which are known to God alone, the Disposer of
all things. We are, indeed, to suppose that the world was
created of such quality and capacity as to contain not only
all those souls which it was determined should be trained in
this world, but also all those powers which were prepared to
attend, and serve, and assist them. For it is established by
many declarations that all rational creatures are of one nature:
on which ground alone could the justice of God in all His
dealings with them be defended, seeing every one has the
reason in himself, why he has been placed in this or that
rank in life.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. This arrangement of things, then, which God afterwards
appointed (for He had, from the very origin of the
world, clearly perceived the reasons and causes affecting
those who, either owing to mental deficiencies, deserved to
enter into bodies, or those who were carried away by their
desire for visible things, and those also who, either willingly
or unwillingly, were compelled, [by Him who subjected the
same in hope], to perform certain services to such as had
fallen into that condition), not being understood by some, who
failed to perceive that it was owing to preceding causes,
originating in free-will, that this variety of arrangement had
been instituted by God, they have concluded that all things
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>in this world are directed either by fortuitous movements or
by a necessary fate, and that nothing is within the power of
our own will. And, therefore, also they were unable to show
that the providence of God was beyond the reach of censure.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. But as we have said that all the souls who lived in
this world stood in need of many ministers, or rulers, or
assistants; so, in the last times, when the end of the world
is already imminent and near, and the whole human race is
verging upon the last destruction, and when not only those
who were governed by others have been reduced to weakness,
but those also to whom had been committed the cares of
government, it was no longer such help nor such defenders
that were needed, but the help of the Author and Creator
Himself was required to restore to the one the discipline of
obedience, which had been corrupted and profaned, and to
the other the discipline of rule. And hence the only-begotten
Son of God, who was the Word and the Wisdom of the
Father, when He was in the possession of that glory with
the Father, which He had before the world was, divested
Himself<a id='r738'></a><a href='#f738' class='c007'><sup>[738]</sup></a> of it, and, taking the form of a servant, was made
obedient unto death, that He might teach obedience to those
who could not otherwise than by obedience obtain salvation.
He restored also the laws of rule and government<a id='r739'></a><a href='#f739' class='c007'><sup>[739]</sup></a> which had
been corrupted, by subduing all enemies under His feet, that
by this means (for it was necessary that He should reign
until He had put all enemies under His feet, and destroyed
the last enemy—death) He might teach rulers themselves
moderation in their government. As He had come, then, to
restore the discipline, not only of government, but of obedience,
as we have said, accomplishing in Himself first what
He desired to be accomplished by others, He became obedient
to the Father, not only to the death of the cross, but also, in
the end of the world, embracing in Himself all whom He
subjects to the Father, and who by Him come to salvation,
He Himself, along with them, and in them, is said also to be
subject to the Father; all things subsisting in Him, and He
Himself being the Head of all things, and in Him being the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>salvation and the fulness of those who obtain salvation. And
this consequently is what the apostle says of Him: “And
when all things shall be subjected to Him, then shall the
Son also Himself be subject to Him that put all things under
Him, that God may be all in all.”</p>

<p class='c006'>7. I know not, indeed, how the heretics, not understanding
the meaning of the apostle in these words, consider the term
“subjection” degrading as applied to the Son; for if the
propriety of the title be called in question, it may easily be
ascertained from making a contrary supposition. Because if
it be not good to be in subjection, it follows that the opposite
will be good, viz. not to be in subjection. Now the language
of the apostle, according to their view, appears to indicate by
these words, “And when all things shall be subdued unto
Him, then shall the Son also Himself be subject unto Him
that put all things under Him,”<a id='r740'></a><a href='#f740' class='c007'><sup>[740]</sup></a> that He, who is not now in
subjection to the Father, will become subject to Him when
the Father shall have first subdued all things unto Him. But
I am astonished how it can be conceived to be the meaning,
that He who, while all things are not yet subdued to Him, is
not Himself in subjection, should—at a time when all things
have been subdued to Him, and when He has become King
of all men, and holds sway over all things—be supposed then
to be made subject, seeing He was not formerly in subjection;
for such do not understand that the subjection of Christ to
the Father indicates that our happiness has attained to perfection,
and that the work undertaken by Him has been
brought to a victorious termination, seeing He has not only
purified the power of supreme government over the whole of
creation, but presents to the Father the principles of the
obedience and subjection of the human race in a corrected
and improved condition.<a id='r741'></a><a href='#f741' class='c007'><sup>[741]</sup></a> If, then, that subjection be held
to be good and salutary by which the Son is said to be subject
to the Father, it is an extremely rational and logical inference
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>to deduce that the subjection also of enemies, which is said
to be made to the Son of God, should be understood as being
also salutary and useful; as if, when the Son is said to be
subject to the Father, the perfect restoration of the whole of
creation is signified, so also, when enemies are said to be
subjected to the Son of God, the salvation of the conquered
and the restoration of the lost is in that understood to consist.</p>

<p class='c006'>8. This subjection, however, will be accomplished in certain
ways, and after certain training, and at certain times; for it
is not to be imagined that the subjection is to be brought about
by the pressure of necessity (lest the whole world should then
appear to be subdued to God by force), but by word, reason,
and doctrine; by a call to a better course of things, by the
best systems of training, by the employment also of suitable
and appropriate threatenings, which will justly impend over
those who despise any care or attention to their salvation and
usefulness. In a word, we men also, in training either our
slaves or children, restrain them by threats and fear while
they are, by reason of their tender age, incapable of using
their reason; but when they have begun to understand what
is good, and useful, and honourable, the fear of the lash being
over, they acquiesce through the suasion of words and reason
in all that is good. But how, consistently with the preservation
of freedom of will in all rational creatures, each one
ought to be regulated, <i>i.e.</i> who they are whom the word of
God finds and trains, as if they were already prepared and
capable of it; who they are whom it puts off to a later time;
who these are from whom it is altogether concealed, and
who are so situated as to be far from hearing it; who those,
again, are who despise the word of God when made known
and preached to them, and who are driven by a kind of correction
and chastisement to salvation, and whose conversion
is in a certain degree demanded and extorted; who those are
to whom certain opportunities of salvation are afforded, so
that sometimes, their faith being proved by an answer alone,<a id='r742'></a><a href='#f742' class='c007'><sup>[742]</sup></a>
they have unquestionably obtained salvation;<a id='r743'></a><a href='#f743' class='c007'><sup>[743]</sup></a>—from what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>causes or on what occasions these results take place, or what
the divine wisdom sees within them, or what movements of
their will leads God so to arrange all these things, is known
to Him alone, and to His only-begotten Son, through whom
all things were created and restored, and to the Holy Spirit,
through whom all things are sanctified, who proceedeth from
the Father,<a id='r744'></a><a href='#f744' class='c007'><sup>[744]</sup></a> to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<h4 id='de-principiis-b3-c6' class='c010'>CHAPTER <abbr title='six'>VI.</abbr> <br> ON THE END OF THE WORLD.</h4>
<p class='c005'>1. Now, respecting the end of the world and the consummation
of all things, we have stated in the preceding pages,
to the best of our ability, so far as the authority of Holy
Scripture enabled us, what we deem sufficient for purposes
of instruction; and we shall here only add a few admonitory
remarks, since the order of investigation has brought us back
to the subject. The highest good, then, after the attainment
of which the whole of rational nature is seeking, which is
also called the end of all blessings,<a id='r745'></a><a href='#f745' class='c007'><sup>[745]</sup></a> is defined by many philosophers
as follows: The highest good, they say, is to become
as like to God as possible. But this definition I regard not
so much as a discovery of theirs, as a view derived from
holy Scripture. For this is pointed out by Moses, before
all other philosophers, when he describes the first creation of
man in these words: “And God said, Let us make man in
our own image, and after our likeness;”<a id='r746'></a><a href='#f746' class='c007'><sup>[746]</sup></a> and then he adds
the words: “So God created man in His own image: in the
image of God created He him; male and female created He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>them, and He blessed them.”<a id='r747'></a><a href='#f747' class='c007'><sup>[747]</sup></a> Now the expression, “In the
image<a id='r748'></a><a href='#f748' class='c007'><sup>[748]</sup></a> of God created He him,” without any mention of the
word “likeness,”<a id='r749'></a><a href='#f749' class='c007'><sup>[749]</sup></a> conveys no other meaning than this, that
man received the dignity of God’s image at his first creation;
but that the perfection of his likeness has been reserved for
the consummation,—namely, that he might acquire it for
himself by the exercise of his own diligence in the imitation
of God, the possibility of attaining to perfection being
granted him at the beginning through the dignity of the
divine image, and the perfect realization of the divine likeness
being reached in the end by the fulfilment of the [necessary]
works. Now, that such is the case, the Apostle John
points out more clearly and unmistakeably, when he makes
this declaration: “Little children, we do not yet know what
we shall be; but if a revelation be made to us from the
Saviour, ye will say, without any doubt, we shall be like
Him.”<a id='r750'></a><a href='#f750' class='c007'><sup>[750]</sup></a> By which expression he points out with the utmost
certainty, that not only was the end of all things to be hoped
for, which he says was still unknown to him, but also the
likeness to God, which will be conferred in proportion to
the completeness of our deserts. The Lord Himself, in the
Gospel, not only declares that these same results are future,
but that they are to be brought about by His own intercession,
He Himself deigning to obtain them from the Father
for His disciples, saying, “Father, I will that where I am,
these also may be with me; and as Thou and I are one, they
also may be one in us.”<a id='r751'></a><a href='#f751' class='c007'><sup>[751]</sup></a> In which the divine likeness itself
already appears to advance, if we may so express ourselves,
and from being merely similar, to become the same,<a id='r752'></a><a href='#f752' class='c007'><sup>[752]</sup></a> because
undoubtedly in the consummation or end God is “all and in
all.” And with reference to this, it is made a question by some<a id='r753'></a><a href='#f753' class='c007'><sup>[753]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>whether the nature of bodily matter, although cleansed and
purified, and rendered altogether spiritual, does not seem
either to offer an obstruction towards attaining the dignity
of the [divine] likeness, or to the property of unity,<a id='r754'></a><a href='#f754' class='c007'><sup>[754]</sup></a> because
neither can a corporeal nature appear capable of any resemblance
to a divine nature, which is certainly incorporeal; nor
can it be truly and deservedly designated one with it, especially
since we are taught by the truths of our religion that
that which alone is one, viz. the Son with the Father, must
be referred to a peculiarity of the [divine] nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Since, then, it is promised that in the end God will be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>all and in all, we are not, as is fitting, to suppose that animals,
either sheep or other cattle, come to that end, lest it
should be implied that God dwelt even in animals, whether
sheep or other cattle; and so, too, with pieces of wood or
stones, lest it should be said that God is in these also. So,
again, nothing that is wicked must be supposed to attain to
that end, lest, while God is said to be in all things, He may also
be said to be in a vessel of wickedness. For if we now assert
that God is everywhere and in all things, on the ground that
nothing can be empty of God, we nevertheless do not say
that He is now “all things” in those in whom He is. And
hence we must look more carefully as to what that is which
denotes the perfection of blessedness and the end of things,
which is not only said to be God in all things, but also “all
in all.” Let us then inquire what all those things are which
God is to become in all.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. I am of opinion that the expression, by which God is
said to be “all in all,” means that He is “all” in each
individual person. Now He will be “all” in each individual
in this way: when all which any rational understanding,
cleansed from the dregs of every sort of vice, and with every
cloud of wickedness completely swept away, can either feel,
or understand, or think, will be wholly God; and when it will
no longer behold or retain anything else than God, but when
God will be the measure and standard of all its movements;
and thus God will be “all,” for there will no longer be any
distinction of good and evil, seeing evil nowhere exists; for
God is all things, and to Him no evil is near: nor will there
be any longer a desire to eat from the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil, on the part of him who is always in the
possession of good, and to whom God is all. So then, when
the end has been restored to the beginning, and the termination
of things compared with their commencement, that
condition of things will be re-established in which rational
nature was placed, when it had no need to eat of the tree of
the knowledge of good and evil; so that when all feeling of
wickedness has been removed, and the individual has been
purified and cleansed, He who alone is the one good God
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>becomes to him “all,” and that not in the case of a few individuals,
or of a considerable number, but He Himself is
“all in all.” And when death shall no longer anywhere
exist, nor the sting of death, nor any evil at all, then verily
God will be “all in all.” But some are of opinion that that
perfection and blessedness of rational creatures, or natures,
can only remain in that same condition of which we have
spoken above, <i>i.e.</i> that all things should possess God, and
God should be to them all things, if they are in no degree
prevented by their union with a bodily nature. Otherwise
they think that the glory of the highest blessedness is impeded
by the intermixture of any material substance.<a id='r755'></a><a href='#f755' class='c007'><sup>[755]</sup></a> But
this subject we have discussed at greater length, as may be
seen in the preceding pages.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. And now, as we find the apostle making mention of a
spiritual body, let us inquire, to the best of our ability, what
idea we are to form of such a thing. So far, then, as our
understanding can grasp it, we consider a spiritual body to
be of such a nature as ought to be inhabited not only by all
holy and perfect souls, but also by all those creatures which
will be liberated from the slavery of corruption. Respecting
the body also, the apostle has said, “We have a house not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>made with hands, eternal in the heavens,”<a id='r756'></a><a href='#f756' class='c007'><sup>[756]</sup></a> <i>i.e.</i> in the mansions
of the blessed. And from this statement we may form
a conjecture, how pure, how refined, and how glorious are
the qualities of that body, if we compare it with those which,
although they are celestial bodies, and of most brilliant
splendour, were nevertheless made with hands, and are visible
to our sight. But of that body it is said, that it is a house
not made with hands, but eternal in the heavens. Since,
then, those things “which are seen are temporal, but those
things which are not seen are eternal,”<a id='r757'></a><a href='#f757' class='c007'><sup>[757]</sup></a> all those bodies
which we see either on earth or in heaven, and which are
capable of being seen, and have been made with hands, but
are not eternal, are far excelled in glory by that which is not
visible, nor made with hands, but is eternal. From which
comparison it may be conceived how great are the comeliness,
and splendour, and brilliancy of a spiritual body; and how
true it is, that “eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor hath
it entered into the heart of man to conceive, what God hath
prepared for them that love Him.”<a id='r758'></a><a href='#f758' class='c007'><sup>[758]</sup></a> We ought not, however,
to doubt that the nature of this present body of ours may, by
the will of God, who made it what it is, be raised to those
qualities of refinement, and purity, and splendour [which
characterize the body referred to], according as the condition
of things requires, and the deserts of our rational nature
shall demand. Finally, when the world required variety and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>diversity, matter yielded itself with all docility throughout
the diverse appearances and species of things to the Creator,
as to its Lord and Maker, that He might educe from it the
various forms of celestial and terrestrial beings. But when
things have begun to hasten to that consummation that all
may be one, as the Father is one with the Son, it may be
understood as a rational inference, that where all are one,
there will no longer be any diversity.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. The last enemy, moreover, who is called death, is said
on this account to be destroyed, that there may not be anything
left of a mournful kind when death does not exist,
nor anything that is adverse when there is no enemy. The
destruction of the last enemy, indeed, is to be understood,
not as if its substance, which was formed by God, is to
perish, but because its mind and hostile will, which came not
from God, but from itself, are to be destroyed. Its destruction,
therefore, will not be its non-existence, but its ceasing
to be an enemy, and [to be] death. For nothing is impossible
to the Omnipotent, nor is anything incapable of restoration<a id='r759'></a><a href='#f759' class='c007'><sup>[759]</sup></a>
to its Creator: for He made all things that they might exist,
and those things which were made for existence cannot cease
to be. For this reason also will they admit of change and
variety, so as to be placed, according to their merits, either
in a better or worse position; but no destruction of substance
can befall those things which were created by God for the
purpose of permanent existence.<a id='r760'></a><a href='#f760' class='c007'><sup>[760]</sup></a> For those things which
agreeably to the common opinion are believed to perish, the
nature either of our faith or of the truth will not permit us
to suppose to be destroyed. Finally, our flesh is supposed
by ignorant men and unbelievers to be destroyed after death,
in such a degree that it retains no relic at all of its former
substance. We, however, who believe in its resurrection,
understand that a change only has been produced by death,
but that its substance certainly remains; and that by the
will of its Creator, and at the time appointed, it will be
restored to life; and that a second time a change will take
place in it, so that what at first was flesh [formed] out of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>earthly soil, and was afterwards dissolved by death, and
again reduced to dust and ashes (“For dust thou art,”<a id='r761'></a><a href='#f761' class='c007'><sup>[761]</sup></a> it is
said, “and to dust shalt thou return”), will be again raised
from the earth, and shall after this, according to the merits
of the indwelling soul, advance to the glory of a spiritual
body.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. Into this condition, then, we are to suppose that all
this bodily substance of ours will be brought, when all things
shall be re-established in a state of unity, and when God
shall be all in all. And this result must be understood as
being brought about, not suddenly, but slowly and gradually,
seeing that the process of amendment and correction will
take place imperceptibly in the individual instances during
the lapse of countless and unmeasured ages, some outstripping
others, and tending by a swifter course towards perfection,<a id='r762'></a><a href='#f762' class='c007'><sup>[762]</sup></a>
while others again follow close at hand, and some again a
long way behind; and thus, through the numerous and uncounted
orders of progressive beings who are being reconciled
to God from a state of enmity, the last enemy is finally
reached, who is called death, so that he also may be destroyed,
and no longer be an enemy. When, therefore, all
rational souls shall have been restored to a condition of this
kind, then the nature of this body of ours will undergo a
change into the glory of a spiritual body. For as we see it
not to be the case with rational natures, that some of them
have lived in a condition of degradation owing to their sins,
while others have been called to a state of happiness on
account of their merits; but as we see those same souls who
had formerly been sinful, assisted, after their conversion and
reconciliation to God, to a state of happiness; so also are we
to consider, with respect to the nature of the body, that the
one which we now make use of in a state of meanness, and
corruption, and weakness, is not a different body from that
which we shall possess in incorruption, and in power, and
in glory; but that the same body, when it has cast away
the infirmities in which it is now entangled, shall be transmuted
into a condition of glory, being rendered spiritual,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>so that what was a vessel of dishonour may, when cleansed,
become a vessel unto honour, and an abode of blessedness.
And in this condition, also, we are to believe, that
by the will of the Creator it will abide for ever without any
change, as is confirmed by the declaration of the apostle,
when he says, “We have a house, not made with hands,
eternal in the heavens.” For the faith of the church does
not admit the view of certain Grecian philosophers, that
there is besides the body, composed of four elements, another
fifth body, which is different in all its parts, and diverse from
this our present body; since neither out of sacred Scripture
can any produce the slightest suspicion of evidence for such
an opinion, nor can any rational inference from things allow
the reception of it, especially when the holy apostle manifestly
declares, that it is not new bodies which are given to
those who rise from the dead, but that they receive those
identical ones which they had possessed when living, transformed
from an inferior into a better condition. For his
words are: “It is sown an animal body, it will rise a spiritual
body: it is sown in corruption, it will arise in incorruption:
it is sown in weakness, it will arise in power: it is sown in
dishonour, it will arise in glory.”<a id='r763'></a><a href='#f763' class='c007'><sup>[763]</sup></a> As, therefore, there is a
kind of advance in man, so that from being first an animal
being, and not understanding what belongs to the Spirit of
God, he reaches by means of instruction the stage of being
made a spiritual being, and of judging all things, while he
himself is judged by no one; so also, with respect to the
state of the body, we are to hold that this very body which
now, on account of its service to the soul, is styled an animal
body, will, by means of a certain progress, when the soul,
united to God, shall have been made one spirit with Him (the
body even then ministering, as it were, to the spirit), attain
to a spiritual condition and quality, especially since, as we
have often pointed out, bodily nature was so formed by the
Creator, as to pass easily into whatever condition He should
wish, or the nature of the case demand.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. The whole of this reasoning, then, amounts to this:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>that God created two general natures,—a visible, <i>i.e.</i> a corporeal
nature; and an invisible nature, which is incorporeal.
Now these two natures admit of two different permutations.
That invisible and rational nature changes in mind and
purpose, because it is endowed with freedom of will, and is
on this account found sometimes to be engaged in the practice
of good, and sometimes in that of the opposite. But this
corporeal nature admits of a change in substance; whence
also God, the arranger of all things, has the service of this
matter at His command in the moulding, or fabrication, or
re-touching of whatever He wishes, so that corporeal nature
may be transmuted, and transformed into any forms or
species whatever, according as the deserts of things may
demand; which the prophet evidently has in view when he
says, “It is God who makes and transforms all things.”<a id='r764'></a><a href='#f764' class='c007'><sup>[764]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>8. And now the point for investigation is, whether, when
God shall be all in all, the whole of bodily nature will, in
the consummation of all things, consist of one species, and
the sole quality of body be that which shall shine in the
indescribable glory which is to be regarded as the future
possession of the spiritual body. For if we rightly understand
the matter, this is the statement of Moses in the beginning
of his book, when he says, “In the beginning God created
the heavens and the earth.”<a id='r765'></a><a href='#f765' class='c007'><sup>[765]</sup></a> For this is the beginning of
all creation: to this beginning the end and consummation
of all things must be recalled, <i>i.e.</i> in order that that heaven
and that earth may be the habitation and resting-place of
the pious; so that all the holy ones, and the meek, may first
obtain an inheritance in that land, since this is the teaching
of the law, and of the prophets, and of the gospel. In which
land I believe there exist the true and living forms of that
worship which Moses handed down under the shadow of the
law; of which it is said, that “they serve unto the example
and shadow of heavenly things”<a id='r766'></a><a href='#f766' class='c007'><sup>[766]</sup></a>—those, viz., who were in
subjection in the law. To Moses himself also was the injunction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>given, “Look that thou make them after the form
and pattern which were showed thee on the mount.”<a id='r767'></a><a href='#f767' class='c007'><sup>[767]</sup></a> From
which it appears to me, that as on this earth the law was a
sort of schoolmaster to those who by it were to be conducted
to Christ, in order that, being instructed and trained by it,
they might more easily, after the training of the law, receive
the more perfect principles of Christ; so also another earth,
which receives into it all the saints, may first imbue and
mould them by the institutions of the true and everlasting
law, that they may more easily gain possession of those perfect
institutions of heaven, to which nothing can be added;
in which there will be, of a truth, that gospel which is called
everlasting, and that Testament, ever new, which shall never
grow old.</p>

<p class='c006'>9. In this way, accordingly, we are to suppose that at the
consummation and restoration of all things, those who make
a gradual advance, and who ascend [in the scale of improvement],
will arrive in due measure and order at that land, and
at that training which is contained in it, where they may be
prepared for those better institutions to which no addition
can be made. For, after His agents and servants, the Lord
Christ, who is King of all, will Himself assume the kingdom;
<i>i.e.</i>, after instruction in the holy virtues, He will Himself
instruct those who are capable of receiving Him in respect of
His being wisdom, reigning in them until He has subjected
them to the Father, who has subdued all things to Himself,
<i>i.e.</i> that when they shall have been made capable of receiving
God, God may be to them all in all. Then accordingly,
as a necessary consequence, bodily nature will obtain that
highest condition<a id='r768'></a><a href='#f768' class='c007'><sup>[768]</sup></a> to which nothing more can be added.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>Having discussed, up to this point, the quality of bodily
nature, or of spiritual body, we leave it to the choice of the
reader to determine what he shall consider best. And here
we may bring the third book to a conclusion.</p>

<h4 id='de-principiis-b4-c1' class='c009'>CHAPTER <abbr title='one'>I.</abbr> <br> THAT THE SCRIPTURES ARE DIVINELY INSPIRED. <br> <br> TRANSLATED FROM THE LATIN OF RUFINUS.</h4>
<p class='c005'>1. But as it is not sufficient, in the discussion of matters of
such importance, to entrust the decision to the human senses
and to the human understanding, and to pronounce on things
invisible as if they were seen by us,<a id='r769'></a><a href='#f769' class='c007'><sup>[769]</sup></a> we must, in order to
establish the positions which we have laid down, adduce the
testimony of Holy Scripture. And that this testimony may produce
a sure and unhesitating belief, either with regard to what
we have still to advance, or to what has been already stated, it
seems necessary to show, in the first place, that the Scriptures
themselves are divine, <i>i.e.</i> were inspired by the Spirit of God.
We shall therefore with all possible brevity draw forth from
the Holy Scriptures themselves, such evidence on this point
as may produce upon us a suitable impression, [making our
quotations] from Moses, the first legislator of the Hebrew
nation, and from the words of Jesus Christ, the Author and
Chief of the Christian religious system.<a id='r770'></a><a href='#f770' class='c007'><sup>[770]</sup></a> For although there
have been numerous legislators among the Greeks and Barbarians,
and also countless teachers and philosophers who
professed to declare the truth, we do not remember any legislator
who was able to produce in the minds of foreign nations
an affection and a zeal [for him] such as led them either
voluntarily to adopt his laws, or to defend them with all the
efforts of their mind. No one, then, has been able to introduce
and make known what seemed to himself the truth,
among, I do not say many foreign nations, but even amongst
the individuals of one single nation, in such a manner that a
knowledge and belief of the same should extend to all. And
yet there can be no doubt that it was the wish of the legislators
that their laws should be observed by all men, if
possible; and of the teachers, that what appeared to themselves
to be truth, should become known to all. But knowing
that they could by no means succeed in producing any such
mighty power within them as would lead foreign nations to
obey their laws, or have regard to their statements, they did
not venture even to essay the attempt, lest the failure of the
undertaking should stamp their conduct with the mark of
imprudence. And yet there are throughout the whole world—throughout
all Greece, and all foreign countries—countless
individuals who have abandoned the laws of their
country, and those whom they had believed to be gods, and
have yielded themselves up to the obedience of the law of
Moses, and to the discipleship and worship of Christ; and have
done this, not without exciting against themselves the intense
hatred of the worshippers of images, so as frequently to be
exposed to cruel tortures from the latter, and sometimes even
to be put to death. And yet they embrace, and with all
affection preserve, the words and teaching of Christ.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>CHAPTER <abbr title='one'>I.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c011'>ON THE INSPIRATION OF HOLY SCRIPTURE, AND HOW THE
SAME IS TO BE READ AND UNDERSTOOD, AND WHAT IS
THE REASON OF THE UNCERTAINTY IN IT; AND OF
THE IMPOSSIBILITY OR IRRATIONALITY OF CERTAIN
THINGS IN IT, TAKEN ACCORDING TO THE LETTER.</p>
<p class='c011'>TRANSLATION FROM THE GREEK.</p>
<p class='c012'>[The translation from the Greek is designedly literal, that the difference
between the original and the paraphrase of Rufinus may be more
clearly seen.]</p>
<p class='c005'>1. Since, in our investigation of matters of such importance,
not satisfied with the common opinions, and with the
clear evidence of visible things,<a id='r771'></a><a href='#f771' class='c007'><sup>[771]</sup></a> we take in addition, for the
proof of our statements, testimonies from what are believed
by us to be divine writings, viz. from that which is called
the Old Testament, and that which is styled the New, and
endeavour by reason to confirm our faith; and as we have
not yet spoken of the Scriptures as divine, come and let us,
as if by way of an epitome, treat of a few points respecting
them, laying down those reasons which lead us to regard
them as divine writings. And before making use of the
words of the writings themselves, and of the things which
are exhibited in them, we must make the following statement
regarding Moses and Jesus Christ,—the lawgiver of the
Hebrews, and the Introducer of the saving doctrines according
to Christianity. For, although there have been very
many legislators among the Greeks and Barbarians, and
teachers who announced opinions which professed to be the
truth, we have heard of no legislator who was able to imbue
other nations with a zeal for the reception of his words;
and although those who professed to philosophize about truth
brought forward a great apparatus of apparent logical demonstration,
no one has been able to impress what was deemed
by him the truth upon other nations, or even on any number
of persons worth mentioning in a single nation. And yet
not only would the legislators have liked to enforce those laws
which appeared to be good, if possible, upon the whole human
race, but the teachers also to have spread what they imagined
to be truth everywhere throughout the world. But as they
were unable to call men of other languages and from many
nations to observe their laws, and accept their teaching, they
did not at all attempt to do this, considering not unwisely the
impossibility of such a result happening to them. Whereas
all Greece, and the barbarous part of our world, contains
innumerable zealots, who have deserted the laws of their
fathers and the established gods, for the observance of the
laws of Moses and the discipleship of the words of Jesus
Christ; although those who clave to the law of Moses were
hated by the worshippers of images, and those who accepted
the words of Jesus Christ were exposed, in addition, to the
danger of death.</p>

  <h4 class='c009'>FROM THE LATIN.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c005'>2. And we may see, moreover, how that religion itself
grew up in a short time, making progress by the punishment
and death of its worshippers, by the plundering of their
goods, and by the tortures of every kind which they endured;
and this result is the more surprising, that even the teachers
of it themselves neither were men of skill,<a id='r772'></a><a href='#f772' class='c007'><sup>[772]</sup></a> nor very numerous;
and yet these words are preached throughout the whole
world, so that Greeks and Barbarians, wise and foolish, adopt
the doctrines of the Christian religion.<a id='r773'></a><a href='#f773' class='c007'><sup>[773]</sup></a> From which it is no
doubtful inference, that it is not by human power or might
that the words of Jesus Christ come to prevail with all faith
and power over the understandings and souls of all men.
For, that these results were both predicted by Him, and
established by divine answers proceeding from Him, is clear
from His own words: “Ye shall be brought before governors
and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the
Gentiles.”<a id='r774'></a><a href='#f774' class='c007'><sup>[774]</sup></a> And again: “This gospel of the kingdom shall
be preached among all nations.”<a id='r775'></a><a href='#f775' class='c007'><sup>[775]</sup></a> And again: “Many shall
say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not eaten and drunk
in Thy name, and in Thy name cast out devils? And I will
say unto them, Depart from me, ye workers of iniquity, I never
knew you.”<a id='r776'></a><a href='#f776' class='c007'><sup>[776]</sup></a> If these sayings, indeed, had been so uttered
by Him, and yet if these predictions had not been fulfilled,
they might perhaps appear to be untrue,<a id='r777'></a><a href='#f777' class='c007'><sup>[777]</sup></a> and not to possess
any authority. But now, when His declarations do pass into
fulfilment, seeing they were predicted with such power and
authority, it is most clearly shown to be true that He, when He
was made man, delivered to men the precepts of salvation.<a id='r778'></a><a href='#f778' class='c007'><sup>[778]</sup></a></p>
<h4 class='c009'>FROM THE GREEK.</h4>
<p class='c005'>2. And if we observe how powerful the word has become
in a very few years, notwithstanding that against those who
acknowledged Christianity conspiracies were formed, and
some of them on its account put to death, and others of them
lost their property, and that, notwithstanding the small number
of its teachers,<a id='r779'></a><a href='#f779' class='c007'><sup>[779]</sup></a> it was preached everywhere throughout
the world, so that Greeks and Barbarians, wise and foolish,
gave themselves up to the worship that is through Jesus,<a id='r780'></a><a href='#f780' class='c007'><sup>[780]</sup></a>
we have no difficulty in saying that the result is beyond
any human power,<a id='r781'></a><a href='#f781' class='c007'><sup>[781]</sup></a> Jesus having taught with all authority
and persuasiveness that His word should not be overcome;
so that we may rightly regard as oracular responses<a id='r782'></a><a href='#f782' class='c007'><sup>[782]</sup></a> those
utterances of His, such as, “Ye shall be brought before governors
and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them
and the Gentiles;”<a id='r783'></a><a href='#f783' class='c007'><sup>[783]</sup></a> and, “Many shall say unto me in that
day, Lord, Lord, have we not eaten in Thy name, and drunk
in Thy name, and in Thy name cast out devils? And I shall say
unto them, Depart from me, ye workers of iniquity, I never
knew you.”<a id='r784'></a><a href='#f784' class='c007'><sup>[784]</sup></a> Now it was perhaps [once] probable that, in
uttering these words, He spoke them in vain, so that they
were not true; but when that which was delivered with so much
authority <i>has</i> come to pass, it shows that God, having really
become man, delivered to men the doctrines of salvation.<a id='r785'></a><a href='#f785' class='c007'><sup>[785]</sup></a></p>

</div>
<p class='c005'>3. What, then, are we to say of this, which the prophets
had beforehand foretold of Him, that princes would not
cease from Judah, nor leaders from between his thighs,
until He should come for whom it has been reserved (viz.
the kingdom), and until the expectation of the Gentiles
should come? For it is most distinctly evident from the
history itself, from what is clearly seen at the present day,
that from the times of Christ onwards there were no kings
amongst the Jews. Nay, even all those objects of Jewish
pride,<a id='r786'></a><a href='#f786' class='c007'><sup>[786]</sup></a> of which they vaunted so much, and in which they
exulted, whether regarding the beauty of the temple or the
ornaments of the altar, and all those sacerdotal fillets and
robes of the high priests, were all destroyed together. For
the prophecy was fulfilled which had declared, “For the
children of Israel shall abide many days without king and
prince: there shall be no victim, nor altar, nor priesthood,
nor answers.”<a id='r787'></a><a href='#f787' class='c007'><sup>[787]</sup></a> These testimonies, accordingly, we employ
against those who seem to assert that what is spoken in
Genesis by Jacob refers to Judah; and who say that there
still remains a prince of the race of Judah—he, viz., who is
the prince of their nation, whom they style Patriarch<a id='r788'></a><a href='#f788' class='c007'><sup>[788]</sup></a>—and
that there cannot fail [a ruler] of his seed, who will remain
until the advent of that Christ whom they picture to themselves.
But if the prophet’s words be true, when he says,
“The children of Israel shall abide many days without king,
without prince; and there shall be no victim, nor altar, nor
priesthood;”<a id='r789'></a><a href='#f789' class='c007'><sup>[789]</sup></a> and if, certainly, since the overthrow of the
temple, victims are neither offered, nor any altar found, nor
any priesthood exists, it is most certain that, as it is written,
princes have departed from Judah, and a leader from between
his thighs, until the coming of him for whom it has been
reserved. It is established, then, that he is come for whom
it has been reserved, and in whom is the expectation of the
Gentiles. And this manifestly seems to be fulfilled in the
multitude of those who have believed on God through Christ
out of the different nations.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>FROM THE GREEK.</h4>
<p class='c005'>3. And what need is there to mention also that it was
predicted of Christ<a id='r790'></a><a href='#f790' class='c007'><sup>[790]</sup></a> that then would the rulers fail from
Judah, and the leaders from his thighs,<a id='r791'></a><a href='#f791' class='c007'><sup>[791]</sup></a> when He came for
whom it is reserved (the kingdom, namely); and that the
expectation of the Gentiles should dwell in the land?<a id='r792'></a><a href='#f792' class='c007'><sup>[792]</sup></a> For
it is clearly manifest from the history, and from what is seen
at the present day, that from the times of Jesus there were
no longer any who were called kings of the Jews;<a id='r793'></a><a href='#f793' class='c007'><sup>[793]</sup></a> all those
Jewish institutions on which they prided themselves—I mean
those arrangements relating to the temple and the altar, and
the offering of the service, and the robes of the high priest—having
been destroyed. For the prophecy was fulfilled
which said, “The children of Israel shall sit many days, there
being no king, nor ruler, nor sacrifice, nor altar, nor priesthood,
nor responses.”<a id='r794'></a><a href='#f794' class='c007'><sup>[794]</sup></a> And these predictions we employ to
answer those who, in their perplexity as to the words spoken
in Genesis by Jacob to Judah, assert that the Ethnarch,<a id='r795'></a><a href='#f795' class='c007'><sup>[795]</sup></a>
being of the race of Judah, is the ruler of the people, and
that there will not fail some of his seed, until the advent of
that Christ whom they figure to their imagination. But if
“the children of Israel are to sit many days without a king,
or ruler, or altar, or priesthood, or responses;” and if, since
the temple was destroyed, there exists no longer sacrifice, nor
altar, nor priesthood, it is manifest that the ruler <i>has</i> failed
out of Judah, and the leader from between his thighs. And
since the prediction declares that “the ruler shall not fail
from Judah, and the leader from between his thighs, until
what is reserved for him shall come,” it is manifest that He
is come to whom [belongs] what is reserved—the expectation
of the Gentiles. And this is clear from the multitude
of the heathen who have believed on God through Jesus
Christ.</p>

<p class='c005'>4. In the song of Deuteronomy,<a id='r796'></a><a href='#f796' class='c007'><sup>[796]</sup></a> also, it is prophetically
declared that, on account of the sins of the former people,
there was to be an election of a foolish nation,—no other,
certainly, than that which was brought about by Christ; for
thus the words run: “They have moved me to anger with
their images, and I will stir them up to jealousy; I will
arouse them to anger against a foolish nation.”<a id='r797'></a><a href='#f797' class='c007'><sup>[797]</sup></a> We may
therefore evidently see how the Hebrews, who are said to
have excited God’s anger by means of those [idols], which
are no gods, and to have aroused His wrath by their images,
were themselves also excited to jealousy by means of a foolish
nation, which God hath chosen by the advent of Jesus Christ
and His disciples. For the following is the language of the
apostle: “For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not
many wise men among you after the flesh, not many mighty,
not many noble (are called): but God has chosen the foolish
things of the world, and the things which are not, to destroy
the things which formerly existed.”<a id='r798'></a><a href='#f798' class='c007'><sup>[798]</sup></a> Carnal Israel, therefore,
should not boast; for such is the term used by the
apostle: “No flesh, I say, should glory in the presence of
God.”<a id='r799'></a><a href='#f799' class='c007'><sup>[799]</sup></a></p>
<h4 class='c009'>FROM THE GREEK.</h4>
<p class='c005'>4. And in the song in Deuteronomy,<a id='r800'></a><a href='#f800' class='c007'><sup>[800]</sup></a> also, it is prophetically
made known that, on account of the sins of the former
people,<a id='r801'></a><a href='#f801' class='c007'><sup>[801]</sup></a> there was to be an election of foolish nations, which
has been brought to pass by no other than by Jesus. “For
they,” He says, “moved me to jealousy with that which is
not God, they have provoked me to anger with their idols;
and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not
a people, and will provoke them to anger with a foolish
nation.”<a id='r802'></a><a href='#f802' class='c007'><sup>[802]</sup></a> Now it is possible to understand with all clearness
how the Hebrews, who are said to have moved God to
jealousy by that which is not God, and to have provoked
Him to anger by their idols, were [themselves] aroused to
jealousy by that which was not a people—the foolish nation,
namely, which God chose by the advent of Jesus Christ and
His disciples. We see, indeed, “our calling, that not many
wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble
(are called); but God hath chosen the foolish things of the
world to confound the wise; and base things, and things that
are despised, hath God chosen, and things that are not, to
bring to nought the things which formerly existed;”<a id='r803'></a><a href='#f803' class='c007'><sup>[803]</sup></a> and let
not the Israel according to the flesh, which is called by the
apostle “flesh,” boast in the presence of God.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>FROM THE LATIN.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c005'>5. What are we to say, moreover, regarding those prophecies
of Christ contained in the Psalms, especially the one
with the superscription, “A song for the Beloved;”<a id='r804'></a><a href='#f804' class='c007'><sup>[804]</sup></a> in which
it is stated that “His tongue is the pen of a ready writer;
fairer than the children of men;” that “grace is poured into
His lips?” Now, the indication that grace has been poured
upon His lips is this, that, after a short period had elapsed—for
He taught only during a year and some months—the
whole world, nevertheless, became filled with His doctrine,
and with faith in His religion. There arose, then, “in His
days righteous men, and abundance of peace,”<a id='r805'></a><a href='#f805' class='c007'><sup>[805]</sup></a> abiding even
to the end, which end is entitled “the taking away of the
moon;” and “His dominion shall extend from sea to sea,
and from the river to the ends of the earth.”<a id='r806'></a><a href='#f806' class='c007'><sup>[806]</sup></a> There was
a sign also given to the house of David. For a virgin
conceived, and bare Emmanuel, which, when interpreted,
signifies, “God with us: know it, O nations, and be overcome.”<a id='r807'></a><a href='#f807' class='c007'><sup>[807]</sup></a>
For we are conquered and overcome, who are of
the Gentiles, and remain as a kind of spoils of His victory,
who have subjected our necks to His grace. Even the place
of His birth was predicted in the prophecies of Micah, who
said, “And thou, Bethlehem, land of Judah, art by no means
small among the leaders of Judah: for out of thee shall come
forth a Leader, who shall rule my people Israel.”<a id='r808'></a><a href='#f808' class='c007'><sup>[808]</sup></a> The
weeks of years, also, which the prophet Daniel had predicted,
extending to the leadership of Christ,<a id='r809'></a><a href='#f809' class='c007'><sup>[809]</sup></a> have been fulfilled.
Moreover, He is at hand, who in the book of Job<a id='r810'></a><a href='#f810' class='c007'><sup>[810]</sup></a> is said
to be about to destroy the huge beast, who also gave power
to His own disciples to tread on serpents and scorpions, and
on all the power of the enemy, without being injured by him.
But if any one will consider the journeys of Christ’s apostles
throughout the different places, in which as His messengers
they preached the gospel, he will find that both what they
ventured to undertake is beyond the power of man, and
what they were enabled to accomplish is from God alone.
If we consider how men, on hearing that a new doctrine was
introduced by these, were able to receive them; or rather,
when desiring often to destroy them, they were prevented by
a divine power which was in them, we shall find that in this
nothing was effected by human strength, but that the whole
was the result of the divine power and providence,—signs
and wonders, manifest beyond all doubt, bearing testimony to
their word and doctrine.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>FROM THE GREEK.</h4>
<p class='c005'>5. And what are we to say regarding the prophecies of
Christ in the Psalms, there being a certain ode with the
superscription “For the Beloved,”<a id='r811'></a><a href='#f811' class='c007'><sup>[811]</sup></a> whose “tongue” is said
to be the “pen of a ready writer, who is fairer than the
sons of men,” since “grace was poured on His lips?” For a
proof that grace was poured on His lips is this, that although
the period of His teaching was short—for He taught somewhere
about a year and a few months—the world has been
filled with His teaching, and with the worship of God
[established] through Him. For there arose “in His days
righteousness and abundance of peace,”<a id='r812'></a><a href='#f812' class='c007'><sup>[812]</sup></a> which abides until
the consummation, which has been called the taking away
of the moon; and He continues “ruling from sea to sea, and
from the rivers to the ends of the earth.”<a id='r813'></a><a href='#f813' class='c007'><sup>[813]</sup></a> And to the house
of David has been given a sign: for the Virgin bore, and
was pregnant,<a id='r814'></a><a href='#f814' class='c007'><sup>[814]</sup></a> and brought forth a son, and His name is
Emmanuel, which is, “God with us;” and as the same prophet
says, the prediction has been fulfilled, “God [is] with us;
know it, O nations, and be overcome; ye who are strong,
be vanquished:”<a id='r815'></a><a href='#f815' class='c007'><sup>[815]</sup></a> for we of the heathen have been overcome
and vanquished, we who have been taken by the grace of His
teaching. The place also of His birth has been foretold in
[the prophecies of] Micah: “For thou, Bethlehem,” he says,
“land of Judah, art by no means the least among the rulers
of Judah; for out of thee shall come forth a Ruler, who shall
rule my people Israel.”<a id='r816'></a><a href='#f816' class='c007'><sup>[816]</sup></a> And according to Daniel, seventy
weeks were fulfilled until [the coming of] Christ the Ruler.<a id='r817'></a><a href='#f817' class='c007'><sup>[817]</sup></a>
And He came, who, according to Job,<a id='r818'></a><a href='#f818' class='c007'><sup>[818]</sup></a> has subdued the great
fish,<a id='r819'></a><a href='#f819' class='c007'><sup>[819]</sup></a> and has given power to His true disciples to tread upon
serpents and scorpions, and all the power of the enemy,<a id='r820'></a><a href='#f820' class='c007'><sup>[820]</sup></a>
without sustaining any injury from them. And let one
notice also the universal advent of the apostles sent by Jesus
to announce the gospel, and he will see both that the undertaking
was beyond human power, and that the commandment
came from God. And if we examine how men, on hearing
new doctrines, and strange words, yielded themselves up to
these teachers, being overcome, amid the very desire to plot
against them, by a divine power that watched over these
[teachers], we shall not be incredulous as to whether they
also wrought miracles, God bearing witness to their words
both by signs, and wonders, and divers miracles.</p>

</div>
<p class='c005'>6. These points now being briefly established, viz. regarding
the deity of Christ, and the fulfilment of all that was
prophesied respecting Him, I think that this position also
has been made good, viz. that the Scriptures themselves,
which contained these predictions, were divinely inspired,—those,
namely, which had either foretold His advent, or
the power of His doctrine, or the bringing over of all
nations [to His obedience]. To which this remark must be
added, that the divinity and inspiration both of the predictions
of the prophets and of the law of Moses have been
clearly revealed and confirmed, especially since the advent of
Christ into the world. For before the fulfilment of those
events which were predicted by them, they could not, although
true and inspired by God, be shown to be so, because they
were as yet unfulfilled. But the coming of Christ was a
declaration that their statements were true and divinely
inspired, although it was certainly doubtful before that
whether there would be an accomplishment of those things
which had been foretold.</p>

<p class='c006'>If any one, moreover, consider the words of the prophets
with all the zeal and reverence which they deserve, it is
certain that, in the perusal and careful examination thus
given them, he will feel his mind and senses touched by a
divine breath, and will acknowledge that the words which he
reads were no human utterances, but the language of God;
and from his own emotions he will feel that these books

eloquence, but, so to speak, of a style that is divine.<a id='r821'></a><a href='#f821' class='c007'><sup>[821]</sup></a> The
splendour of Christ’s advent, therefore, illuminating the law
of Moses by the light of truth, has taken away that veil
which had been placed over the letter [of the law], and has
unsealed, for every one who believes upon Him, all the
blessings which were concealed by the covering of the word.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>FROM THE GREEK.</h4>
<p class='c005'>6. And while we thus briefly<a id='r822'></a><a href='#f822' class='c007'><sup>[822]</sup></a> demonstrate the deity of
Christ, and [in so doing] make use of the prophetic declarations
regarding Him, we demonstrate at the same time that
the writings which prophesied of Him were divinely inspired;
and that those documents which announced His coming and
His doctrine were given forth with all power and authority,
and that on this account they obtained the election from the
Gentiles.<a id='r823'></a><a href='#f823' class='c007'><sup>[823]</sup></a>, We must say, also, that the divinity of the prophetic
declarations, and the spiritual nature of the law of
Moses, shone forth after the advent of Christ. For before
the advent of Christ it was not altogether possible to exhibit
manifest proofs of the divine inspiration of the ancient
Scriptures; whereas His coming led those who might suspect
the law and the prophets not to be divine, to the clear conviction
that they were composed by [the aid of] heavenly
grace. And he who reads the words of the prophets with
care and attention, feeling by the very perusal the traces of
the divinity<a id='r824'></a><a href='#f824' class='c007'><sup>[824]</sup></a> that is in them, will be led by his own emotions
to believe that those words which have been deemed to be
the words of God are not the compositions of men. The
light, moreover, which was contained in the law of Moses,
but which had been concealed by a veil, shone forth at the
advent of Jesus, the veil being taken away, and those blessings,
the shadow of which was contained in the letter, coming
forth gradually to the knowledge [of men].</p>

</div>
<p class='c005'>7. It is, however, a matter attended with considerable
labour, to point out, in every instance, how and when the
predictions of the prophets were fulfilled, so as to appear to
confirm those who are in doubt, seeing it is possible for every
one who wishes to become more thoroughly acquainted with
these things, to gather abundant proofs from the records of
the truth themselves. But if the sense of the letter, which
is beyond man, does not appear to present itself at once, on
the first glance, to those who are less versed in divine discipline,
it is not at all to be wondered at, because divine things
are brought down somewhat slowly to [the comprehension of]
men, and elude the view in proportion as one is either sceptical
or unworthy. For although it is certain that all things
which exist in this world, or take place in it, are ordered by
the providence of God, and certain events indeed do appear
with sufficient clearness to be under the disposal of His providential
government, yet others again unfold themselves so
mysteriously and incomprehensibly, that the plan of Divine
Providence with regard to them is completely concealed; so
that it is occasionally believed by some that particular occurrences
do not belong to [the plan of] Providence, because
the principle eludes their grasp, according to which the works
of Divine Providence are administered with indescribable
skill; which principle of administration, however, is not
equally concealed from all. For even among men themselves,
one individual devotes less consideration to it, another
more; while by every man, He who is on earth, whoever is
the inhabitant of heaven, is more acknowledged.<a id='r825'></a><a href='#f825' class='c007'><sup>[825]</sup></a> And the
nature of bodies is clear to us in one way, that of trees in
another, that of animals in a third; the nature of souls,
again, is concealed in a different way; and the manner in
which the diverse movements of rational understandings are
ordered by Providence, eludes the view of men in a greater
degree, and even, in my opinion, in no small degree that of
the angels also. But as the existence of divine providence
is not refuted by those especially who are certain of its existence,
but who do not comprehend its workings or arrangements
by the powers of the human mind; so neither will the
divine inspiration of holy Scripture, which extends throughout
its body, be believed to be non-existent, because the
weakness of our understanding is unable to trace out the
hidden and secret meaning in each individual word, the
treasure of divine wisdom being hid in the vulgar and unpolished
vessels of words,<a id='r826'></a><a href='#f826' class='c007'><sup>[826]</sup></a> as the apostle also points out
when he says, “We have this treasure in earthen vessels,”<a id='r827'></a><a href='#f827' class='c007'><sup>[827]</sup></a>
that the virtue of the divine power may shine out the more
brightly, no colouring of human eloquence being intermingled
with the truth of the doctrines. For if our books induced men
to believe because they were composed either by rhetorical
arts or by the wisdom of philosophy, then undoubtedly our
faith would be considered to be based on the art of words, and
on human wisdom, and not upon the power of God; whereas
it is now known to all that the word of this preaching has
been so accepted by numbers throughout almost the whole
world, because they understood their belief to rest not on the
persuasive words of human wisdom, but on the manifestation
of the Spirit and of power. On which account, being led by
a heavenly, nay, by a more than heavenly power, to faith
and acceptance,<a id='r828'></a><a href='#f828' class='c007'><sup>[828]</sup></a> that we may worship the sole Creator of all
things as our God, let us also do our utmost endeavour, by
abandoning the language of the elements of Christ, which
are but the first beginnings of wisdom, to go on to perfection,
in order that that wisdom which is given to them who are
perfect, may be given to us also. For such is the promise of
him to whom was entrusted the preaching of this wisdom, in
the words: “Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are
perfect; yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes
of this world, who will be brought to nought;”<a id='r829'></a><a href='#f829' class='c007'><sup>[829]</sup></a> by which
he shows that this wisdom of ours has nothing in common,
so far as regards the beauty of language, with the wisdom of
this world. This wisdom, then, will be inscribed more clearly
and perfectly on our hearts, if it be made known to us according
to the revelation of the mystery which has been hid
from eternity,<a id='r830'></a><a href='#f830' class='c007'><sup>[830]</sup></a> but now is manifest through the Scriptures of
prophecy, and the advent of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ, to whom be glory for ever. Amen.
Many, not understanding the Scriptures in a spiritual
sense, but incorrectly,<a id='r831'></a><a href='#f831' class='c007'><sup>[831]</sup></a> have fallen into heresies.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>FROM THE GREEK.</h4>
<p class='c005'>7. It would be tedious now to enumerate the most ancient
prophecies respecting each future event, in order that the
doubter, being impressed by their divinity, may lay aside all
hesitation and distraction, and devote himself with his whole
soul to the words of God. But if in every part of the Scriptures
the superhuman element of thought<a id='r832'></a><a href='#f832' class='c007'><sup>[832]</sup></a> does not seem to
present itself to the uninstructed, that is not at all wonderful;
for, with respect to the works of that providence which embraces
the whole world, some show with the utmost clearness
that they are works of providence, while others are so concealed
as to seem to furnish ground for unbelief with respect
to that God who orders all things with unspeakable skill and
power. For the artistic plan<a id='r833'></a><a href='#f833' class='c007'><sup>[833]</sup></a> of a providential Ruler is not
so evident in those matters belonging to the earth, as in the
case of the sun, and moon, and stars; and not so clear in
what relates to human occurrences, as it is in the souls and
bodies of animals,—the object and reason of the impulses, and
phantasies and natures of animals, and the structure of their
bodies, being carefully ascertained by those who attend to
these things.<a id='r834'></a><a href='#f834' class='c007'><sup>[834]</sup></a> But as [the doctrine of] providence is not at
all weakened<a id='r835'></a><a href='#f835' class='c007'><sup>[835]</sup></a> (on account of those things which are not
understood) in the eyes of those who have once honestly accepted
it, so neither is the divinity of Scripture, which extends
to the whole of it, [lost] on account of the inability of our
weakness to discover in every expression the hidden splendour
of the doctrines veiled in common and unattractive
phraseology.<a id='r836'></a><a href='#f836' class='c007'><sup>[836]</sup></a> For we have the treasure in earthen vessels,
that the excellency of the power of God may shine forth, and
that it may not be deemed to proceed from us [who are but]
human beings. For if the hackneyed<a id='r837'></a><a href='#f837' class='c007'><sup>[837]</sup></a> methods of demonstration
[common] among men, contained in the books [of
the Bible], had been successful in producing conviction, then
our faith would rightly have been supposed to rest on the
wisdom of men, and not on the power of God; but now it
is manifest to every one who lifts up his eyes, that the word
and preaching have not prevailed among the multitude
“by persuasive words of wisdom, but by demonstration of
the Spirit and of power.”<a id='r838'></a><a href='#f838' class='c007'><sup>[838]</sup></a> Wherefore, since a celestial or
even a super-celestial power compels us to worship the only
Creator, let us leave the doctrine of the beginning of Christ,
<i>i.e.</i> the elements,<a id='r839'></a><a href='#f839' class='c007'><sup>[839]</sup></a> and endeavour to go on to perfection, in
order that the wisdom spoken to the perfect may be spoken
to us also. For he who possesses it promises to speak wisdom
among them that are perfect, but another wisdom than that
of this world, and of the rulers of this world, which is
brought to nought. And this wisdom will be distinctly
stamped<a id='r840'></a><a href='#f840' class='c007'><sup>[840]</sup></a> upon us, and will produce a revelation of the
mystery that was kept silent in the eternal ages,<a id='r841'></a><a href='#f841' class='c007'><sup>[841]</sup></a> but now
has been manifested through the prophetic Scriptures, and
the appearance of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, to
whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class='c005'>8. These particulars, then, being briefly stated regarding
the inspiration of the sacred Scriptures by the Holy
Spirit, it seems necessary to explain this point also, viz. how
certain persons, not reading them correctly, have given themselves
over to erroneous opinions, inasmuch as the procedure
to be followed, in order to attain an understanding of the
holy writings, is unknown to many. The Jews, in fine,
owing to the hardness of their heart, and from a desire to
appear wise in their own eyes, have not believed in our Lord
and Saviour, judging that those statements which were
uttered respecting Him ought to be understood literally, <i>i.e.</i>
that He ought in a sensible and visible manner to preach
deliverance to the captives, and first build a city which they
truly deem the city of God, and cut off at the same time
the chariots of Ephraim,<a id='r842'></a><a href='#f842' class='c007'><sup>[842]</sup></a> and the horse from Jerusalem;
that He ought also to eat butter and honey,<a id='r843'></a><a href='#f843' class='c007'><sup>[843]</sup></a> in order to
choose the good before He should come to know how to bring
forth evil.<a id='r844'></a><a href='#f844' class='c007'><sup>[844]</sup></a> They think, also, that it has been predicted that
the wolf—that four-footed animal—is, at the coming of
Christ, to feed with the lambs, and the leopard to lie down
with kids, and the calf and the bull to pasture with lions, and
that they are to be led by a little child to the pasture; that
the ox and the bear are to lie down together in the green
fields, and that their young ones are to be fed together;
that lions also will frequent stalls with the oxen, and feed on
straw. And seeing that, according to history, there was no
accomplishment of any of those things predicted of Him,
in which they believed the signs of Christ’s advent were
especially to be observed, they refused to acknowledge the
presence of our Lord Jesus Christ; nay, contrary to all the
principles of human and divine law,<a id='r845'></a><a href='#f845' class='c007'><sup>[845]</sup></a> <i>i.e.</i> contrary to the faith
of prophecy, they crucified Him for assuming to Himself the
name of Christ. Thereupon the heretics, reading that it is
written in the law, “A fire has been kindled in mine anger;”<a id='r846'></a><a href='#f846' class='c007'><sup>[846]</sup></a>
and that “I the Lord am a jealous [God], visiting the sins
of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth
generation;”<a id='r847'></a><a href='#f847' class='c007'><sup>[847]</sup></a> and that “it repenteth me that I anointed
Saul to be king;”<a id='r848'></a><a href='#f848' class='c007'><sup>[848]</sup></a> and, “I am the Lord, who make peace
and create evil;”<a id='r849'></a><a href='#f849' class='c007'><sup>[849]</sup></a> and again, “There is not evil in a city
which the Lord hath not done;”<a id='r850'></a><a href='#f850' class='c007'><sup>[850]</sup></a> and, “Evils came down
from the Lord upon the gates of Jerusalem;”<a id='r851'></a><a href='#f851' class='c007'><sup>[851]</sup></a> and, “An
evil spirit from the Lord plagued Saul;”<a id='r852'></a><a href='#f852' class='c007'><sup>[852]</sup></a> and reading many
other passages similar to these, which are found in Scripture,
they did not venture to assert that these were not the Scriptures
of God, but they considered them to be the words of
that creator God whom the Jews worshipped, and who,
they judged, ought to be regarded as just only, and not also
as good; but that the Saviour had come to announce to us
a more perfect God, who, they allege, is not the creator of
the world,—there being different and discordant opinions
among them even on this very point, because, when they
once depart from a belief in God the Creator, who is Lord
of all, they have given themselves over to various inventions
and fables, devising certain [fictions], and asserting that some
things were visible, and made by one [God], and that certain
other things were invisible, and were created by another,
according to the vain and fanciful suggestions of their own
minds. But not a few also of the more simple of those,
who appear to be restrained within the faith of the church,
are of opinion that there is no greater God than the Creator,
holding in this a correct and sound opinion; and yet they
entertain regarding Him such views as would not be entertained
regarding the most unjust and cruel of men.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>FROM THE GREEK.</h4>
<p class='c005'>8. Having spoken thus briefly<a id='r853'></a><a href='#f853' class='c007'><sup>[853]</sup></a> on the subject of the
divine inspiration of the holy Scriptures, it is necessary to
proceed to the [consideration of the] manner in which they
are to be read and understood, seeing numerous errors have
been committed in consequence of the method in which the
holy documents<a id='r854'></a><a href='#f854' class='c007'><sup>[854]</sup></a> ought to be examined,<a id='r855'></a><a href='#f855' class='c007'><sup>[855]</sup></a> not having been
discovered by the multitude. For both the hardened in
heart, and the ignorant persons<a id='r856'></a><a href='#f856' class='c007'><sup>[856]</sup></a> belonging to the circumcision,
have not believed on our Saviour, thinking that they
are following the language of the prophecies respecting Him,
and not perceiving in a manner palpable to their senses<a id='r857'></a><a href='#f857' class='c007'><sup>[857]</sup></a> that
He had proclaimed liberty to the captives, nor that He had
built up what they truly consider the city of God, nor cut off
“the chariots of Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem,”<a id='r858'></a><a href='#f858' class='c007'><sup>[858]</sup></a>
nor eaten butter and honey, and, before knowing or preferring
the evil, had selected the good.<a id='r859'></a><a href='#f859' class='c007'><sup>[859]</sup></a> And thinking, moreover,
that it was prophesied that the wolf—the four-footed
animal—was to feed with the lamb, and the leopard to lie
down with the kid, and the calf and bull and lion to feed
together, being led by a little child, and that the ox and
bear were to pasture together, their young ones growing up
together, and that the lion was to eat straw like the ox:<a id='r860'></a><a href='#f860' class='c007'><sup>[860]</sup></a>
seeing none of these things visibly accomplished during the
advent of Him who is believed by us to be Christ, they did
not accept our Lord Jesus; but, as having called Himself
Christ improperly,<a id='r861'></a><a href='#f861' class='c007'><sup>[861]</sup></a> they crucified Him. And those belonging
to heretical sects reading this [statement], “A fire has
been kindled in mine anger;”<a id='r862'></a><a href='#f862' class='c007'><sup>[862]</sup></a> and this, “I am a jealous
God, visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the children
unto the third and fourth generation;”<a id='r863'></a><a href='#f863' class='c007'><sup>[863]</sup></a> and this, “I repent
of having anointed Saul to be king;”<a id='r864'></a><a href='#f864' class='c007'><sup>[864]</sup></a> and this, “I
am a God that maketh peace, and createth evil;”<a id='r865'></a><a href='#f865' class='c007'><sup>[865]</sup></a> and,
among others, this, “There is not wickedness in the city
which the Lord hath not done;”<a id='r866'></a><a href='#f866' class='c007'><sup>[866]</sup></a> and again this, “Evils
came down from the Lord upon the gates of Jerusalem;”<a id='r867'></a><a href='#f867' class='c007'><sup>[867]</sup></a>
and, “An evil spirit from the Lord plagued Saul;”<a id='r868'></a><a href='#f868' class='c007'><sup>[868]</sup></a> and
countless other passages like these—they have not ventured
to disbelieve these as the Scriptures of God; but believing
them to be the [words] of the Demiurge, whom the Jews
worship, they thought that as the Demiurge was an imperfect
and unbenevolent God, the Saviour had come to announce a
more perfect Deity, who, they say, is not the Demiurge,
being of different opinions regarding Him; and having once
departed from the Demiurge, who is the only uncreated God,
they have given themselves up to fictions, inventing to themselves
hypotheses, according to which they imagine that there
are some things which are visible, and certain other things
which are not visible, all which are the fancies of their own
minds. And yet, indeed, the more simple among those who
profess to belong to the church have supposed that there is
no deity greater than the Demiurge, being right in so thinking,
while they imagine regarding Him such things as would
not be believed of the most savage and unjust of mankind.</p>

<p class='c005'>9. Now the reason of the erroneous apprehension of all
these points on the part of those whom we have mentioned
above, is no other than this, that holy Scripture is not understood
by them according to its spiritual, but according to its
literal meaning. And therefore we shall endeavour, so far
as our moderate capacity will permit, to point out to those
who believe the holy Scriptures to be no human compositions,
but to be written by inspiration of the Holy Spirit,
and to be transmitted and entrusted to us by the will of God
the Father, through His only-begotten Son Jesus Christ, what
appears to us, who observe things by a right way of understanding,<a id='r869'></a><a href='#f869' class='c007'><sup>[869]</sup></a>
to be the standard and discipline delivered to the
apostles by Jesus Christ, and which they handed down in
succession to their posterity, the teachers of the holy church.
Now, that there are certain mystical economies<a id='r870'></a><a href='#f870' class='c007'><sup>[870]</sup></a> indicated in
holy Scripture, is admitted by all, I think, even the simplest
of believers. But what these are, or of what kind they are,
he who is rightly minded, and not overcome with the vice of
boasting, will scrupulously<a id='r871'></a><a href='#f871' class='c007'><sup>[871]</sup></a> acknowledge himself to be ignorant.
For if any one, <i>e.g.</i>, were to adduce the case of the
daughters of Lot, who seem, contrary to the law of God,<a id='r872'></a><a href='#f872' class='c007'><sup>[872]</sup></a> to
have had intercourse with their father, or that of the two
wives of Abraham, or of the two sisters who were married
to Jacob, or of the two handmaids who increased the number
of his sons, what other answer could be returned than that
these were certain mysteries,<a id='r873'></a><a href='#f873' class='c007'><sup>[873]</sup></a> and forms of spiritual things,
but that we are ignorant of what nature they are? Nay,
even when we read of the construction of the tabernacle, we
deem it certain that the written descriptions are the figures
of certain hidden things; but to adapt these to their appropriate
standards, and to open up and discuss every individual
point, I consider to be exceedingly difficult, not to say impossible.
That that description, however, is, as I have said,
full of mysteries, does not escape even the common understanding.
But all the narrative portion, relating either to
the marriages, or to the begetting of the children, or to
battles of different kinds, or to any other histories whatever,
what else can they be supposed to be, save the forms and
figures of hidden and sacred things? As men, however,
make little effort to exercise their intellect, or imagine that
they possess knowledge before they really learn, the consequence
is that they never begin to have knowledge; or if
there be no want of a desire, at least, nor of an instructor,
and if divine knowledge be sought after, as it ought to be,
in a religious and holy spirit, and in the hope that many
points will be opened up by the revelation of God—since to
human sense they are exceedingly difficult and obscure—then,
perhaps, he who seeks in such a manner will find what
it is lawful<a id='r874'></a><a href='#f874' class='c007'><sup>[874]</sup></a> to discover.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>FROM THE GREEK.</h4>
<p class='c005'>9. Now the cause, in all the points previously enumerated,
of the false opinions, and of the impious statements or
ignorant assertions<a id='r875'></a><a href='#f875' class='c007'><sup>[875]</sup></a> about God, appears to be nothing else
than the not understanding the Scripture according to its
spiritual meaning, but the interpretation of it agreeably to
the mere letter. And therefore, to those who believe that
the sacred books are not the compositions of men, but that
they were composed by inspiration<a id='r876'></a><a href='#f876' class='c007'><sup>[876]</sup></a> of the Holy Spirit,
agreeably to the will of the Father of all things through
Jesus Christ, and that they have come down to us, we must
point out the ways [of interpreting them] which appear
[correct] to us, who cling to the standard<a id='r877'></a><a href='#f877' class='c007'><sup>[877]</sup></a> of the heavenly
church of Jesus Christ according to the succession of the
apostles. Now, that there are certain mystical economies
made known by the holy Scriptures, all—even the most
simple of those who adhere to the word—have believed; but
what these are, candid and modest individuals confess that
they know not. If, then, one were to be perplexed about
the intercourse of Lot with his daughters, and about the two
wives of Abraham, and the two sisters married to Jacob, and
the two handmaids who bore him children, they can return
no other answer than this, that these are mysteries not understood
by us. Nay, also, when the [description of the] fitting
out of the tabernacle is read, believing that what is written is
a type,<a id='r878'></a><a href='#f878' class='c007'><sup>[878]</sup></a> they seek to adapt what they can to each particular
related about the tabernacle,—not being wrong so far as regards
their belief that the tabernacle is a type of <i>something</i>, but
erring sometimes in adapting the description of that of which
the tabernacle is a type, to some special thing in a manner
worthy of Scripture. And all the history that is considered
to tell of marriages, or the begetting of children, or of wars,
or any histories whatever that are in circulation among
the multitude, they declare to be types; but of what in each
individual instance, partly owing to their habits not being
thoroughly exercised—partly, too, owing to their precipitation—sometimes,
even when an individual does happen to be well
trained and clear-sighted, owing to the excessive difficulty of
discovering things on the part of men,—the nature of each
particular regarding these [types] is not clearly ascertained.</p>

to exist only in the language of the prophets, seeing the
prophetic style is allowed by all to abound in figures and
enigmas, what do we find when we come to the Gospels?
Is there not hidden there also an inner, namely a divine
sense, which is revealed by that grace alone which he had
received who said, “But we have the mind of Christ, that
we might know the things freely given to us by God.

certainly <i>is</i> concealed. And yet are not the epistles
of the apostles, which seem to some to be plainer, filled with
meanings so profound, that by means of them, as by some
small receptacle,<a id='r881'></a><a href='#f881' class='c007'><sup>[881]</sup></a> the clearness of incalculable light<a id='r882'></a><a href='#f882' class='c007'><sup>[882]</sup></a> appears
to be poured into those who are capable of understanding the
meaning of divine wisdom? And therefore, because this is
the case, and because there are many who go wrong in this
life, I do not consider that it is easy to pronounce, without
danger, that any one knows or understands those things,
which, in order to be opened up, need the key of knowledge;
which key, the Saviour declared, lay with those who were
skilled in the law. And here, although it is a digression, I
think we should inquire of those who assert that before the
advent of the Saviour there was no truth among those who
were engaged in the study of the law, how it could be said
by our Lord Jesus Christ that the keys of knowledge were
with them, who had the books of the prophets and of the
law in their hands. For thus did He speak: “Woe unto
you, ye teachers of the law, who have taken away the key
of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them who
wished to enter in ye hindered.”<a id='r883'></a><a href='#f883' class='c007'><sup>[883]</sup></a></p>
<h4 class='c009'>FROM THE GREEK.</h4>
<p class='c005'>10. And what need is there to speak of the prophecies,
which we all know to be filled with enigmas and dark
sayings? And if we come to the Gospels, the exact understanding
of these also, as being the mind of Christ, requires
the grace that was given to him who said, “But we have
the mind of Christ, that we might know the things freely
given to us by God. Which things also we speak, not in the
words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Spirit
teacheth.”<a id='r884'></a><a href='#f884' class='c007'><sup>[884]</sup></a> And who, on reading the revelations made to
John, would not be amazed at the unspeakable mysteries
therein concealed, and which are evident [even] to him who
does not comprehend what is written? And to what person,
skilful in investigating words, would the epistles of the
apostles seem to be clear and easy of understanding, since
even in them there are countless numbers of most profound
ideas, which, [issuing forth] as by an aperture, admit of no
rapid comprehension?<a id='r885'></a><a href='#f885' class='c007'><sup>[885]</sup></a> And therefore, since these things
are so, and since innumerable individuals fall into mistakes,
it is not safe in reading [the Scriptures] to declare that one
easily understands what needs the key of knowledge, which
the Saviour declares is with the lawyers. And let those
answer who will not allow that the truth was with these
before the advent of Christ, how the key of knowledge is
said by our Lord Jesus Christ to be with those who, as they
allege, had not the books which contain the secrets<a id='r886'></a><a href='#f886' class='c007'><sup>[886]</sup></a> of
knowledge, and perfect mysteries.<a id='r887'></a><a href='#f887' class='c007'><sup>[887]</sup></a> For His words run thus:
“Woe unto you, ye lawyers! for ye have taken away the
key of knowledge: ye have not entered in yourselves, and
them that were entering in ye hindered.”<a id='r888'></a><a href='#f888' class='c007'><sup>[888]</sup></a></p>

</div>
<p class='c005'>11. But, as we had begun to observe, the way which
seems to us the correct one for the understanding of the
Scriptures, and for the investigation of their meaning, we
consider to be of the following kind: for we are instructed
by Scripture itself in regard to the ideas which we ought to
form of it. In the Proverbs of Solomon we find some such
rule as the following laid down, respecting the consideration
of holy Scripture: “And do thou,” he says, “describe these
things to thyself in a threefold manner, in counsel and
knowledge, and that thou mayest answer the words of truth
to those who have proposed them to thee.”<a id='r889'></a><a href='#f889' class='c007'><sup>[889]</sup></a> Each one,
then, ought to describe in his own mind, in a threefold
manner, the understanding of the divine letters,—that is,
in order that all the more simple individuals may be edified,
so to speak, by the very body of Scripture; for such we
term that common and historical sense: while, if some have
commenced to make considerable progress, and are able to
see something more [than that], <i>they</i> may be edified by the
very soul of Scripture. Those, again, who are perfect, and
who resemble those of whom the apostle says, “We speak
wisdom among them that are perfect, but not the wisdom
of this world, nor of the princes of this world, who will be
brought to nought; but we speak the wisdom of God, hidden
in a mystery, which God hath decreed before the ages unto
our glory;”<a id='r890'></a><a href='#f890' class='c007'><sup>[890]</sup></a>—all such as these may be edified by the
spiritual law itself (which has a shadow of good things to
come), as if by the Spirit. For as man is said to consist of
body, and soul, and spirit, so also does sacred Scripture,
which has been granted by the divine bounty<a id='r891'></a><a href='#f891' class='c007'><sup>[891]</sup></a> for the salvation
of man; which we see pointed out, moreover, in the
little book of <i>The Shepherd</i>, which seems to be despised by
some, where Hermas is commanded to write two little books,
and afterwards to announce to the presbyters of the church
what he learned from the Spirit. For these are the words
that are written: “And you will write,” he says, “two
books; and you will give the one to Clement, and the other to
Grapte.<a id='r892'></a><a href='#f892' class='c007'><sup>[892]</sup></a> And let Grapte admonish the widows and orphans,
and let Clement send through all the cities which are abroad,
while you will announce to the presbyters of the church.”
Grapte, accordingly, who is commanded to admonish the
orphans and widows, is the pure understanding of the letter
itself; by which those youthful minds are admonished, who
have not yet deserved to have God as their Father, and are
on that account styled orphans. They, again, are the widows,
who have withdrawn themselves from the unjust man, to
whom they had been united contrary to law; but who have
remained widows, because they have not yet advanced to the
stage of being joined to a heavenly Bridegroom. Clement,
moreover, is ordered to send into those cities which are
abroad what is written to those individuals who already are
withdrawing from the letter,—as if the meaning were to
those souls who, being built up by this means, have begun to
rise above the cares of the body and the desires of the flesh;
while he himself, who had learned from the Holy Spirit, is
commanded to announce, not by letter nor by book, but by
the living voice, to the presbyters of the church of Christ,
<i>i.e.</i> to those who possess a mature faculty of wisdom, capable
of receiving spiritual teaching.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>FROM THE GREEK.</h4>
<p class='c005'>11. The way, then, as it appears to us, in which we ought
to deal with the Scriptures, and extract from them their
meaning, is the following, which has been ascertained from
the Scriptures themselves. By Solomon in the Proverbs
we find some such rule as this enjoined respecting the divine
doctrines of Scripture:<a id='r893'></a><a href='#f893' class='c007'><sup>[893]</sup></a> “And do thou portray them in a
threefold manner, in counsel and knowledge, to answer words
of truth to them who propose them to thee.”<a id='r894'></a><a href='#f894' class='c007'><sup>[894]</sup></a> The individual
ought, then, to portray the ideas of holy Scripture in
a threefold manner upon his own soul; in order that the
simple man may be edified by the “flesh,” as it were, of the
Scripture, for so we name the obvious sense; while he who
has ascended a certain way [may be edified] by the “soul,”
as it were. The perfect man, again, and he who resembles
those spoken of by the apostle, when he says, “We speak
wisdom among them that are perfect, but not the wisdom
of the world, nor of the rulers of this world, who come to
nought; but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, the
hidden wisdom, which God hath ordained before the ages,
unto our glory,”<a id='r895'></a><a href='#f895' class='c007'><sup>[895]</sup></a> [may receive edification] from the spiritual
law, which has a shadow of good things to come. For as
man consists of body, and soul, and spirit, so in the same
way does Scripture, which has been arranged to be given by
God for the salvation of men. And therefore we deduce
this also from a book which is despised by some—<i>The
Shepherd</i>—in respect of the command given to Hermas to
write two books, and after so doing to announce to the
presbyters of the church what he had learned from the
Spirit. The words are as follow: “You will write two
books, and give one to Clement, and one to Grapte. And
Grapte shall admonish the widows and the orphans, and
Clement will send to the cities abroad, while you will announce
to the presbyters of the church.”<a id='r896'></a><a href='#f896' class='c007'><sup>[896]</sup></a> Now Grapte,
who admonishes the widows and the orphans, is the mere
letter [of Scripture], which admonishes those who are yet
children in soul, and not able to call God their Father, and
who are on that account styled orphans,—admonishing,
moreover, those who no longer have an unlawful bridegroom,<a id='r897'></a><a href='#f897' class='c007'><sup>[897]</sup></a>
but who remain widows, because they have not yet become
worthy of the [heavenly] Bridegroom; while Clement, who
is already beyond the letter, is said to send what is written
to the cities abroad, as if we were to call these the “souls,”
who are above [the influence of] bodily [affections] and
degraded<a id='r898'></a><a href='#f898' class='c007'><sup>[898]</sup></a> ideas,—the disciple of the Spirit himself being
enjoined to make known, no longer by letters, but by living
words, to the presbyters of the whole church of God, who
have become grey<a id='r899'></a><a href='#f899' class='c007'><sup>[899]</sup></a> through wisdom.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>FROM THE LATIN.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c005'>12. This point, indeed, is not to be passed by without
notice, viz. that there are certain passages of Scripture where
this “body,” as we termed it, <i>i.e.</i> this inferential historical
sense,<a id='r900'></a><a href='#f900' class='c007'><sup>[900]</sup></a> is not always found, as we shall prove to be the case
in the following pages, but where that which we termed
“soul” or “spirit” can only be understood. And this, I
think, is indicated in the Gospels, where there are said to
be placed, according to the manner of purification among
the Jews, six water-vessels, containing two or three firkins<a id='r901'></a><a href='#f901' class='c007'><sup>[901]</sup></a>
a-piece; by which, as I have said, the language of the
Gospel seems to indicate, with respect to those who are
secretly called by the apostle “Jews,” that they are purified
by the word of Scripture,—receiving indeed sometimes two
firkins, <i>i.e.</i> the understanding of the “soul” or “spirit,”
according to our statement as above; sometimes even three
[firkins], when in the reading [of Scripture] the “bodily”
sense, which is the “historical,” may be preserved for the
edification of the people. Now six water-vessels are appropriately
spoken of, with regard to those persons who are purified
by being placed in the world; for we read that in six
days—which is the perfect number—this world and all things
in it were finished. How great, then, is the utility of this first
“historical” sense which we have mentioned, is attested by the
multitude of all believers, who believe with adequate faith
and simplicity, and does not need much argument, because
it is openly manifest to all; whereas of that sense which
we have called above the “soul,” as it were, of Scripture,
the Apostle Paul has given us numerous examples in the
first Epistle to the Corinthians. For we find the expression,
“Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth
out the corn.”<a id='r902'></a><a href='#f902' class='c007'><sup>[902]</sup></a> And afterwards, when explaining what
precept ought to be understood by this, he adds the words:
“Doth God take care for oxen? or saith He it altogether
for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written;
that he who plougheth should plough in hope, and he that
thresheth, in hope of partaking.”<a id='r903'></a><a href='#f903' class='c007'><sup>[903]</sup></a> Very many other passages
also of this nature, which are in this way explained of
the law, contribute extensive information to the hearers.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>FROM THE GREEK.</h4>
<p class='c005'>12. But as there are certain passages of Scripture which
do not at all contain the “corporeal” sense, as we shall
show in the following [paragraphs], there are also places
where we must seek only for the “soul,” as it were, and
“spirit” of Scripture. And perhaps on this account the
water-vessels containing two or three firkins a-piece are said
to lie for the purification of the Jews, as we read in the
Gospel according to John: the expression darkly intimating,
with respect to those who [are called] by the apostle “Jews”
secretly, that they are purified by the word of Scripture,
receiving sometimes two firkins, <i>i.e.</i>, so to speak, the “psychical”
and “spiritual” sense; and sometimes three firkins,
since some have, in addition to those already mentioned, also
the “corporeal” sense, which is capable of [producing] edification.
And six water-vessels are reasonably [appropriate]
to those who are purified in the world, which was made in
six days—the perfect number. That the first “sense,” then,
is profitable in this respect, that it is capable of imparting
edification, is testified by the multitudes of genuine and
simple believers; while of that interpretation which is referred
back to the “soul,” there is an illustration in Paul’s
first Epistle to the Corinthians. The expression is, “Thou
shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the
corn;”<a id='r904'></a><a href='#f904' class='c007'><sup>[904]</sup></a> to which he adds, “Doth God take care of oxen?
or saith He it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no
doubt, this was written: that he that plougheth should plough
in hope, and that he who thresheth, in hope of partaking.”<a id='r905'></a><a href='#f905' class='c007'><sup>[905]</sup></a>
And there are numerous interpretations adapted to the multitude
which are in circulation, and which edify those who are
unable to understand profounder meanings, and which have
somewhat the same character.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>FROM THE LATIN.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c005'>13. Now a “spiritual” interpretation is of this nature:
when one is able to point out what are the heavenly things
of which these serve as the patterns and shadow, who are
Jews “according to the flesh,” and of what things future
the law contains a shadow, and any other expressions of this
kind that may be found in holy Scripture; or when it is a
subject of inquiry, what is that wisdom hidden in a mystery
which “God ordained before the world for our glory, which
none of the princes of this world knew;”<a id='r906'></a><a href='#f906' class='c007'><sup>[906]</sup></a> or the meaning of
the apostle’s language, when, employing certain illustrations
from Exodus or Numbers, he says: “These things happened
to them in a figure,<a id='r907'></a><a href='#f907' class='c007'><sup>[907]</sup></a> and they are written on our account, on
whom the ends of the ages have come.”<a id='r908'></a><a href='#f908' class='c007'><sup>[908]</sup></a> Now, an opportunity
is afforded us of understanding of what those things
which happened to them were figures, when he adds: “And
they drank of that spiritual rock which followed them, and
that rock was Christ.”<a id='r909'></a><a href='#f909' class='c007'><sup>[909]</sup></a> In another epistle also, when referring
to the tabernacle, he mentions the direction which
was given to Moses: “Thou shalt make [all things] according
to the pattern which was showed thee in the mount.”<a id='r910'></a><a href='#f910' class='c007'><sup>[910]</sup></a> And
writing to the Galatians, and upbraiding certain individuals
who seem to themselves to read the law, and yet without
understanding it, because of their ignorance of the fact that
an allegorical meaning underlies what is written, he says to
them in a certain tone of rebuke: “Tell me, ye who desire
to be under the law, do ye not hear the law? For it is written
that Abraham had two sons; the one by a bond maid, the
other by a free woman. But he who was of the bond
woman was born according to the flesh; but he of the free
woman was by promise. Which things are an allegory: for
these are the two covenants.”<a id='r911'></a><a href='#f911' class='c007'><sup>[911]</sup></a> And here this point is to be
attended to, viz. the caution with which the apostle employs
the expression, “Ye who are under the law, do ye not hear
the law?” Do ye not <i>hear</i>, <i>i.e.</i> do ye not understand and
know? In the Epistle to the Colossians, again, briefly summing
up and condensing the meaning of the whole law,
he says: “Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in
drink, or in respect of holy days, or of the new moon, or
of the Sabbath, which are a shadow of things to come.”<a id='r912'></a><a href='#f912' class='c007'><sup>[912]</sup></a>
Writing to the Hebrews also, and treating of those who belong
to the circumcision, he says: “Those who serve to the
example and shadow of heavenly things.”<a id='r913'></a><a href='#f913' class='c007'><sup>[913]</sup></a> Now perhaps,
through these illustrations, no doubt will be entertained
regarding the five books of Moses, by those who hold the
writings of the apostle, as divinely inspired. And if they
require, with respect to the rest of the history, that those
events which are contained in it should be considered as
having happened for an ensample to those of whom they are
written, we have observed that this also has been stated
in the Epistle to the Romans, where the apostle adduces an
instance from the third book of Kings, saying, “I have left
me seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to
Baal;”<a id='r914'></a><a href='#f914' class='c007'><sup>[914]</sup></a> which expression Paul understood as figuratively
spoken of those who are called Israelites according to the
election, in order to show that the advent of Christ had not
only now been of advantage to the Gentiles, but that very
many even of the race of Israel had been called to salvation.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>FROM THE GREEK.</h4>
<p class='c005'>13. But the interpretation is “spiritual,” when one is able
to show of what heavenly things the Jews “according to
the flesh” served as an example and a shadow, and of what
future blessings the law contains a shadow. And, generally,
we must investigate, according to the apostolic promise, “the
wisdom in a mystery, the hidden wisdom which God ordained
before the world for the glory” of the just, which “none of
the princes of this world knew.”<a id='r915'></a><a href='#f915' class='c007'><sup>[915]</sup></a> And the same apostle
says somewhere, after referring to certain events mentioned
as occurring in Exodus and Numbers, “that these things
happened to them figuratively, but that they were written on
our account, on whom the ends of the world are come.”<a id='r916'></a><a href='#f916' class='c007'><sup>[916]</sup></a>
And he gives an opportunity for ascertaining of what things
these were patterns, when he says: “For they drank of the
spiritual rock that followed them, and that rock was Christ.”<a id='r917'></a><a href='#f917' class='c007'><sup>[917]</sup></a>
And in another epistle, when sketching the various matters
relating to the tabernacle, he used the words: “Thou shalt
make everything according to the pattern showed thee in the
mount.”<a id='r918'></a><a href='#f918' class='c007'><sup>[918]</sup></a> Moreover, in the Epistle to the Galatians, as if
upbraiding those who think that they read the law, and yet
do not understand it, judging that those do not understand it
who do not reflect that allegories are contained under what
is written, he says: “Tell me, ye that desire to be under
the law, do ye not hear the law? For it is written, Abraham
had two sons; the one by the bond maid, the other by the
free woman. But he who was by the bond maid was born
according to the flesh; but he of the free woman was by
promise. Which things are an allegory:<a id='r919'></a><a href='#f919' class='c007'><sup>[919]</sup></a> for these are the two
covenants,” and so on. Now we must carefully observe each
word employed by him. He says: “Ye who desire to be
under the law,” not “Ye that are under the law;” and, “Do
ye not <i>hear</i> the law?”—“hearing” being understood to mean
“<i>comprehending</i>” and “<i>knowing</i>.” And in the Epistle to the
Colossians, briefly abridging the meaning of the whole legislation,
he says: “Let no man therefore judge you in meat,
and in drink, or in respect of a festival, or of a new moon, or
of Sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come.”<a id='r920'></a><a href='#f920' class='c007'><sup>[920]</sup></a> Moreover,
in the Epistle to the Hebrews, discoursing of those
who belong to the circumcision, he writes: “who serve for
an ensample and shadow of heavenly things.”<a id='r921'></a><a href='#f921' class='c007'><sup>[921]</sup></a> Now it is
probable that, from these illustrations, those will entertain no
doubt with respect to the five books of Moses, who have once
given in their adhesion to the apostle, as divinely inspired;<a id='r922'></a><a href='#f922' class='c007'><sup>[922]</sup></a>
but do you wish to know, with regard to the rest of the history,
if it also happened as a pattern? We must note, then, the
expression in the Epistle to the Romans, “I have left to
myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to
Baal,”<a id='r923'></a><a href='#f923' class='c007'><sup>[923]</sup></a> quoted from the third book of Kings, which Paul
has understood as equivalent [in meaning] to those who are
Israelites according to election, because not only were the
Gentiles benefited by the advent of Christ, but also certain
of the race of God.<a id='r924'></a><a href='#f924' class='c007'><sup>[924]</sup></a></p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>FROM THE LATIN.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c005'>14. This being the state of the case, we shall sketch out,
as if by way of illustration and pattern, what may occur to
us with regard to the manner in which Holy Scripture is to
be understood on these several points, repeating in the first
instance, and pointing out this fact, that the Holy Spirit, by
the providence and will of God, through the power of His
only-begotten Word, who was in the beginning God with
God, enlightened the ministers of truth, the prophets and
apostles, to understand the mysteries of those things or
causes which take place among men, or with respect to men.<a id='r925'></a><a href='#f925' class='c007'><sup>[925]</sup></a>
And by “men,” I now mean souls that are placed in bodies,
who, relating those mysteries that are known to them, and
revealed through Christ, as if they were a kind of human
transactions, or handing down certain legal observances and
injunctions, described them figuratively;<a id='r926'></a><a href='#f926' class='c007'><sup>[926]</sup></a> not that any one
who pleased might view these expositions as deserving to be
trampled under foot, but that he who should devote himself
with all chastity, and sobriety, and watchfulness, to studies
of this kind, might be able by this means to trace out the
meaning of the Spirit of God, which is perhaps lying profoundly
buried, and the context, which may be pointing again
in another direction than the ordinary usage of speech would
indicate. And in this way he might become a sharer in the
knowledge of the Spirit, and a partaker in the divine counsel,
because the soul cannot come to the perfection of knowledge
otherwise than by inspiration of the truth of the divine
wisdom. Accordingly, it is of God, <i>i.e.</i> of the Father, and
of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, that these men, filled
with the Divine Spirit, chiefly treat; then the mysteries
relating to the Son of God—how the Word became flesh,
and why He descended even to the assumption of the form
of a servant—are the subject, as I have said, of explanation
by those persons who are filled with the Divine Spirit. It
next followed, necessarily, that they should instruct mortals
by divine teaching, regarding rational creatures, both those
of heaven and the happier ones of earth; and also [should
explain] the differences among souls, and the origin of these
differences; and then should tell what this world is, and why
it was created; whence also sprung the great and terrible
wickedness which extends over the earth. And whether that
wickedness is found on this earth only, or in other places, is
a point which it was necessary for us to learn from divine
teaching. Since, then, it was the intention of the Holy Spirit
to enlighten with respect to these and similar subjects, those
holy souls who had devoted themselves to the service of the
truth, this object was kept in view, in the second place,
viz. for the sake of those who either could not or would not
give themselves to this labour and toil by which they might
deserve to be instructed in or to recognise things of such
value and importance, to wrap up and conceal, as we said
before, in ordinary language, under the covering of some
history and narrative of visible things, hidden mysteries.
There is therefore introduced the narrative of the visible
creation, and the creation and formation of the first man;
then the offspring which followed from him in succession,
and some of the actions which were done by the good among
his posterity, are related, and occasionally certain crimes also,
which are stated to have been committed by them as being
human; and afterwards certain unchaste or wicked deeds also
are narrated as being the acts of the wicked. The description
of battles, moreover, is given in a wonderful manner,
and the alternations of victors and vanquished, by which certain
ineffable mysteries are made known to those who know
how to investigate statements of that kind. By an admirable
discipline of wisdom, too, the law of truth, even of the
prophets, is implanted in the Scriptures of the law, each of
which is woven by a divine art of wisdom, as a kind of
covering and veil of spiritual truths; and this is what we
have called the “body” of Scripture, so that also, in this
way, what we have called the covering of the letter, woven
by the art of wisdom, might be capable of edifying and
profiting many, when others would derive no benefit.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>FROM THE GREEK.</h4>
<p class='c005'>14. This being the state of the case, we have to sketch
what seem to us to be the marks of the [true] understanding
of Scriptures. And, in the first place, this must be pointed
out, that the object of the Spirit, which by the providence of
God, through the Word who was in the beginning with
God, illuminated the ministers of truth, the prophets and
apostles, was especially [the communication] of ineffable
mysteries regarding the affairs of men (now by men I mean
those souls that make use of bodies), in order that he who is
capable of instruction may by investigation, and by devoting
himself to the study of the profundities of meaning contained
in the words, become a participator of all the doctrines of his
counsel. And among those matters which relate to souls
(who cannot otherwise obtain perfection apart from the rich
and wise truth of God), the [doctrines] belonging to God and
His only-begotten Son are necessarily laid down as primary,
viz. of what nature He is, and in what manner He is the
Son of God, and what are the causes of His descending
even to [the assumption of] human flesh, and of complete
humanity; and what, also, is the operation of this [Son],
and upon whom and when exercised. And it was necessary
also that the subject of kindred beings, and other rational
creatures, both those who are divine and those who have
fallen from blessedness, together with the reasons of their
fall, should be contained in the divine teaching; and also
that of the diversities of souls, and of the origin of these
diversities, and of the nature of the world, and the cause of
its existence. We must learn also the origin of the great
and terrible wickedness which overspreads the earth, and
whether it is confined to this earth only, or prevails elsewhere.
Now, while these and similar objects were present
to the Spirit, who enlightened the souls of the holy ministers
of the truth, there was a second object, for the sake of those
who were unable to endure the fatigue of investigating
matters so important, viz. to conceal the doctrine relating to
the previously mentioned subjects, in expressions containing
a narrative which conveyed an announcement regarding the
things of the visible creation,<a id='r927'></a><a href='#f927' class='c007'><sup>[927]</sup></a> the creation of man, and the
successive descendants of the first men until they became
numerous; and other histories relating the acts of just men,
and the sins occasionally committed by these same men as
being human beings, and the wicked deeds, both of unchastity
and vice, committed by sinful and ungodly men. And what
is most remarkable, by the history of wars, and of the victors,
and the vanquished, certain mysteries are indicated to those
who are able to test these statements. And more wonderful
still, the laws of truth are predicted by the written legislation;—all
these being described in a connected series, with
a power which is truly in keeping with the wisdom of God.
For it was intended that the covering also of the spiritual
truths—I mean the “bodily” part of Scripture—should not
be without profit in many cases, but should be capable of
improving the multitude, according to their capacity.</p>

  <h4 class='c009'>FROM THE LATIN.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c005'>15. But as if, in all the instances of this covering (<i>i.e.</i> of
this history), the logical connection and order of the law had
been preserved, we would not certainly believe, when thus
possessing the meaning of Scripture in a continuous series,
that anything else was contained in it save what was indicated
on the surface; so for that reason divine wisdom took
care that certain stumbling-blocks, or interruptions,<a id='r928'></a><a href='#f928' class='c007'><sup>[928]</sup></a> to the
historical meaning should take place, by the introduction into
the midst [of the narrative] of certain impossibilities and incongruities;
that in this way the very interruption of the
narrative might, as by the interposition of a bolt, present an
obstacle to the reader, whereby he might refuse to acknowledge
the way which conducts to the ordinary meaning; and
being thus excluded and debarred from it, we might be
recalled to the beginning of another way, in order that, by
entering upon a narrow path, and passing to a loftier and
more sublime road, he might lay open the immense breadth
of divine wisdom.<a id='r929'></a><a href='#f929' class='c007'><sup>[929]</sup></a> This, however, must not be unnoted by
us, that as the chief object of the Holy Spirit is to preserve
the coherence of the spiritual meaning, either in those things
which ought to be done or which have been already performed,
if He anywhere finds that those events which, according
to the history, took place, can be adapted to a spiritual
meaning, He composed a texture of both kinds in one style
of narration, always concealing the hidden meaning more
deeply; but where the historical narrative could not be made
appropriate to the spiritual coherence of the occurrences, He
inserted sometimes certain things which either did not take
place or could not take place; sometimes also what might
happen, but what did not: and He does this at one time in
a few words, which, taken in their “bodily” meaning, seem
incapable of containing truth, and at another by the insertion
of many. And this we find frequently to be the case in
the legislative portions, where there are many things manifestly
useful among the “bodily” precepts, but a very great
number also in which no principle of utility is at all discernible,
and sometimes even things which are judged to be
impossibilities. Now all this, as we have remarked, was done
by the Holy Spirit in order that, seeing those events which
lie on the surface can be neither true nor useful, we may be
led to the investigation of that truth which is more deeply
concealed, and to the ascertaining of a meaning worthy of
God in those Scriptures which we believe to be inspired
by Him.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>FROM THE GREEK.</h4>
<p class='c005'>15. But since, if the usefulness of the legislation, and the
sequence and beauty<a id='r930'></a><a href='#f930' class='c007'><sup>[930]</sup></a> of the history, were universally evident
of itself,<a id='r931'></a><a href='#f931' class='c007'><sup>[931]</sup></a> we should not believe that any other thing could
be understood in the Scriptures save what was obvious, the
word of God has arranged that certain stumbling-blocks, as
it were, and offences, and impossibilities, should be introduced
into the midst of the law and the history, in order that we may
not, through being drawn away in all directions by the merely
attractive nature of the language,<a id='r932'></a><a href='#f932' class='c007'><sup>[932]</sup></a> either altogether fall away
from the [true] doctrines, as learning nothing worthy of God,
or, by not departing from the letter, come to the knowledge
of nothing more divine. And this also we must know, that
the principal aim being to announce the “spiritual” connection
in those things that are done, and that ought to be done,
where the Word found that things done according to the history
could be adapted to these mystical senses, He made use
of them, concealing from the multitude the deeper meaning;
but where, in the narrative of the development of super-sensual
things,<a id='r933'></a><a href='#f933' class='c007'><sup>[933]</sup></a> there did not follow the performance of those
certain events, which was already indicated by the mystical
meaning, the Scripture interwove in the history [the account
of] some event that did not take place, sometimes what could
not have happened; sometimes what could, but did not. And
sometimes a few words are interpolated which are not true
in their literal acceptation,<a id='r934'></a><a href='#f934' class='c007'><sup>[934]</sup></a> and sometimes a larger number.
And a similar practice also is to be noticed with regard to
the legislation, in which is often to be found what is useful
in itself, and appropriate to the times of the legislation; and
sometimes also what does not appear to be of utility; and
at other times impossibilities are recorded for the sake of the
more skilful and inquisitive, in order that they may give
themselves to the toil of investigating what is written, and
thus attain to a becoming conviction of the manner in which
a meaning worthy of God must be sought out in such subjects.</p>

</div>
<p class='c005'>16. Nor was it only with regard to those Scriptures which
were composed down to the advent of Christ that the Holy
Spirit thus dealt; but as being one and the same Spirit, and
proceeding from one God, He dealt in the same way with
the evangelists and apostles. For even those narratives which
He inspired them to write were not composed without the
aid of that wisdom of His, the nature of which we have above
explained. Whence also in them were intermingled not a
few things by which, the historical order of the narrative
being interrupted and broken up, the attention of the reader
might be recalled, by the impossibility of the case, to an examination
of the inner meaning. But, that our meaning
may be ascertained by the facts themselves, let us examine
the passages of Scripture. Now who is there, pray, possessed
of understanding, that will regard the statement as
appropriate,<a id='r935'></a><a href='#f935' class='c007'><sup>[935]</sup></a> that the first day, and the second, and the third,
in which also both evening and morning are mentioned,
existed without sun, and moon, and stars—the first day even
without a sky? And who is found so ignorant as to suppose
that God, as if He had been a husbandman, planted trees in
paradise, in Eden towards the east, and a tree of life in it,
<i>i.e.</i> a visible and palpable tree of wood,<a id='r936'></a><a href='#f936' class='c007'><sup>[936]</sup></a> so that any one
eating of it with bodily teeth should obtain life, and, eating
again of another tree, should come to the knowledge of good
and evil? No one, I think, can doubt that the statement
that God walked in the afternoon in paradise, and that Adam
lay hid under a tree, is related figuratively in Scripture, that
some mystical meaning may be indicated by it. The departure
of Cain from the presence of the Lord will manifestly
cause a careful reader to inquire what is the presence of God,
and how any one can go out from it. But not to extend the
task which we have before us beyond its due limits, it is very
easy for any one who pleases to gather out of holy Scripture
what is recorded indeed as having been done, but what
nevertheless cannot be believed as having reasonably and
appropriately occurred according to the historical account.
The same style of scriptural narrative occurs abundantly
in the Gospels, as when the devil is said to have placed Jesus
on a lofty mountain, that he might show Him from thence
all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them. How
could it literally come to pass, either that Jesus should be
led up by the devil into a high mountain, or that the latter
should show Him all the kingdoms of the world (as if they
were lying beneath his bodily eyes, and adjacent to one
mountain), <i>i.e.</i> the kingdom of the Persians, and Scythians,
and Indians? or how could he show in what manner the
kings of these kingdoms are glorified by men? And many
other instances similar to this will be found in the Gospels
by any one who will read them with attention, and will observe
that in those narratives which appear to be literally
recorded, there are inserted and interwoven things which
cannot be admitted historically, but which may be accepted
in a spiritual signification.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>FROM THE GREEK.</h4>
<p class='c005'>16. It was not only, however, with the [Scriptures composed]
before the advent [of Christ] that the Spirit thus
dealt; but as being the same Spirit, and [proceeding] from
the one God, He did the same thing both with the evangelists
and the apostles,—as even these do not contain throughout a
pure history of events, which are interwoven indeed according
to the letter, but which did not actually occur.<a id='r937'></a><a href='#f937' class='c007'><sup>[937]</sup></a> Nor
even do the law and the commandments wholly convey what
is agreeable to reason. For who that has understanding will
suppose that the first, and second, and third day, and the
evening and the morning, existed without a sun, and moon,
and stars? and that the first day was, as it were, also without
a sky? And who is so foolish as to suppose that God,
after the manner of a husbandman, planted a paradise in
Eden, towards the east, and placed in it a tree of life, visible
and palpable, so that one tasting of the fruit by the bodily
teeth obtained life? and again, that one was a partaker of
good and evil by masticating what was taken from the tree?
And if God is said to walk in the paradise in the evening,
and Adam to hide himself under a tree, I do not suppose
that any one doubts that these things figuratively indicate
certain mysteries, the history having taken place in appearance,
and not literally.<a id='r938'></a><a href='#f938' class='c007'><sup>[938]</sup></a> Cain also, when going forth from
the presence of God, certainly appears to thoughtful men
as likely to lead the reader to inquire what is the presence
of God, and what is the meaning of going out from Him.
And what need is there to say more, since those who are not
altogether blind can collect countless instances of a similar
kind recorded as having occurred, but which did not literally<a id='r939'></a><a href='#f939' class='c007'><sup>[939]</sup></a>
take place? Nay, the Gospels themselves are filled with the
same kind of narratives; <i>e.g.</i> the devil leading Jesus up into
a high mountain, in order to show Him from thence the kingdoms
of the whole world, and the glory of them. For who
is there among those who do not read such accounts carelessly,
that would not condemn those who think that with
the eye of the body—which requires a lofty height in order
that the parts lying [immediately] under and adjacent may
be seen—the kingdoms of the Persians, and Scythians, and
Indians, and Parthians, were beheld, and the manner in
which their princes are glorified among men? And the
attentive reader may notice in the Gospels innumerable other
passages like these, so that he will be convinced that in the
histories that are literally recorded, circumstances that did
not occur are inserted.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>FROM THE LATIN.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c005'>17. In the passages containing the commandments also,
similar things are found. For in the law Moses is commanded
to destroy every male that is not circumcised on the
eighth day, which is exceedingly incongruous,<a id='r940'></a><a href='#f940' class='c007'><sup>[940]</sup></a> since it would
be necessary, if it were related that the law was executed
according to the history, to command those parents to be
punished who did not circumcise their children, and also
those who were the nurses of little children. The declaration
of Scripture now is, “The uncircumcised male, <i>i.e.</i> who
shall not have been circumcised, shall be cut off from his
people.”<a id='r941'></a><a href='#f941' class='c007'><sup>[941]</sup></a> And if we are to inquire regarding the impossibilities
of the law, we find an animal called the goat-stag,<a id='r942'></a><a href='#f942' class='c007'><sup>[942]</sup></a>
which cannot possibly exist, but which, as being in the number
of clean beasts, Moses commands to be eaten; and a griffin,<a id='r943'></a><a href='#f943' class='c007'><sup>[943]</sup></a>
which no one ever remembers or heard of as yielding to
human power, but which the legislator forbids to be used for
food. Respecting the celebrated<a id='r944'></a><a href='#f944' class='c007'><sup>[944]</sup></a> observance of the Sabbath
also he thus speaks: “Ye shall sit, every one in your dwellings;
no one shall move from his place on the Sabbath-day.”<a id='r945'></a><a href='#f945' class='c007'><sup>[945]</sup></a>
Which precept it is impossible to observe literally; for no
man can sit a whole day so as not to move from the place
where he sat down. With respect to each one of these points
now, those who belong to the circumcision, and all who would
have no more meaning to be found in sacred Scripture than
what is indicated by the letter, consider that there should be
no investigation regarding the goat-stag, and the griffin, and
the vulture; and they invent some empty and trifling tales
about the Sabbath, drawn from some traditional sources or
other, alleging that every one’s place is computed to him
within two thousand cubits.<a id='r946'></a><a href='#f946' class='c007'><sup>[946]</sup></a> Others, again, among whom is
Dositheus the Samaritan, censure indeed expositions of this
kind, but themselves lay down something more ridiculous,
viz. that each one must remain until the evening in the
posture, place, or position in which he found himself on the
Sabbath-day; <i>i.e.</i> if found sitting, he is to sit the whole day,
or if reclining, he is to recline the whole day. Moreover,
the injunction which runs, “Bear no burden on the Sabbath-day,”<a id='r947'></a><a href='#f947' class='c007'><sup>[947]</sup></a>
seems to me an impossibility. For the Jewish doctors,
in consequence of these [prescriptions], have betaken themselves,
as the holy apostle says, to innumerable fables, saying
that it is not accounted a burden if a man wear shoes without
nails, but that it is a burden if shoes with nails be worn;
and that if it be carried on one shoulder, they consider it a
burden; but if on both, they declare it to be none.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>FROM THE GREEK.</h4>
<p class='c005'>17. And if we come to the legislation of Moses, many of
the laws manifest the irrationality, and others the impossibility,
of their literal<a id='r948'></a><a href='#f948' class='c007'><sup>[948]</sup></a> observance. The irrationality [in this],
that the people are forbidden to eat vultures, although no one
even in the direst famines was [ever] driven by want to have
recourse to this bird; and that children eight days old,
which are uncircumcised, are ordered to be exterminated
from among their people, it being necessary, if the law were
to be carried out at all literally with regard to these, that
their fathers, or those with whom they are brought up, should
be commanded to be put to death. Now the Scripture says:
“Every male that is uncircumcised, who shall not be circumcised
on the eighth day, shall be cut off from among his
people.”<a id='r949'></a><a href='#f949' class='c007'><sup>[949]</sup></a> And if you wish to see impossibilities contained
in the legislation, let us observe that the goat-stag is one of
those animals that cannot exist, and yet Moses commands us
to offer it as being a clean beast; whereas a griffin, which is
not recorded ever to have been subdued by man, the lawgiver
forbids to be eaten. Nay, he who carefully considers [the
famous injunction relating to] the Sabbath, “Ye shall sit
each one in your dwellings; let no one go out from his place
on the seventh day,”<a id='r950'></a><a href='#f950' class='c007'><sup>[950]</sup></a> will deem it impossible to be literally
observed: for no living being is able to sit throughout a
whole day, and remain without moving from a sitting position.
And therefore those who belong to the circumcision,
and all who desire that no meaning should be exhibited,
save the literal one, do not investigate at all such subjects
as those of the goat-stag and griffin and vulture, but
indulge in foolish talk on certain points, multiplying words
and adducing tasteless<a id='r951'></a><a href='#f951' class='c007'><sup>[951]</sup></a> traditions; as, for example, with
regard to the Sabbath, saying that two thousand cubits is
each one’s limit.<a id='r952'></a><a href='#f952' class='c007'><sup>[952]</sup></a> Others, again, among whom is Dositheus
the Samaritan, condemning such an interpretation, think that
in the position in which a man is found on the Sabbath-day,
he is to remain until evening. Moreover, the not carrying
of a burden on the Sabbath-day is an impossibility; and
therefore the Jewish teachers have fallen into countless absurdities,<a id='r953'></a><a href='#f953' class='c007'><sup>[953]</sup></a>
saying that a shoe of such a kind was a burden,
but not one of another kind; and that a sandal which had
nails was a burden, but not one that was without them; and
in like manner what was borne on one shoulder [was a load],
but not that which was carried on both.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>FROM THE LATIN.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c005'>18. And now, if we institute a similar examination with
regard to the Gospels, how shall it appear otherwise than
absurd to take the injunction literally, “Salute no man by
the way?”<a id='r954'></a><a href='#f954' class='c007'><sup>[954]</sup></a> And yet there are simple individuals, who think
that our Saviour gave this command to His apostles! How,
also, can it appear possible for such an order as this to be
observed, especially in those countries where there is a rigorous
winter, attended by frost and ice, viz. that one should possess
“neither two coats, nor shoes?”<a id='r955'></a><a href='#f955' class='c007'><sup>[955]</sup></a> And this, that when one
is smitten on the right cheek, he is ordered to present the left
also, since every one who strikes with the <i>right</i> hand smites
the <i>left</i> cheek? This precept also in the Gospels must be
accounted among impossibilities, viz. that if the right eye
“offend” thee, it is to be plucked out; for even if we were
to suppose that bodily eyes were spoken of, how shall it appear
appropriate, that when both eyes have the property of sight,
the responsibility of the “offence” should be transferred to
one eye, and that the right one? Or who shall be considered
free of a crime of the greatest enormity, that lays hands upon
himself? But perhaps the epistles of the Apostle Paul will
appear to be beyond this. For what is his meaning, when he
says, “Is any man called, being circumcised? Let him not
become uncircumcised.”<a id='r956'></a><a href='#f956' class='c007'><sup>[956]</sup></a> This expression indeed, in the first
place, does not on careful consideration seem to be spoken
with reference to the subject of which he was treating at the
time, for this discourse consisted of injunctions relating to
marriage and to chastity; and these words, therefore, will
have the appearance of an unnecessary addition to such a
subject. In the second place, however, what objection would
there be, if, for the sake of avoiding that unseemliness which
is caused by circumcision, a man were able to become uncircumcised?<a id='r957'></a><a href='#f957' class='c007'><sup>[957]</sup></a>
And, in the third place, that is altogether
impossible.</p>

<p class='c006'>The object of all these statements on our part, is to show
that it was the design of the Holy Spirit, who deigned to
bestow upon us the sacred Scriptures, to show that we were
not to be edified by the letter alone, or by everything in it,—a
thing which we see to be frequently impossible and inconsistent;
for in that way not only absurdities, but impossibilities,
would be the result; but that we are to understand that
certain occurrences were interwoven in this “visible” history,
which, when considered and understood in their inner meaning,
give forth a law which is advantageous to men and
worthy of God.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>FROM THE GREEK.</h4>
<p class='c005'>18. And if we go to the Gospel and institute a similar
examination, what would be more irrational than [to take
literally the injunction], “Salute no man by the way,”<a id='r958'></a><a href='#f958' class='c007'><sup>[958]</sup></a>
which simple persons think the Saviour enjoined on the
apostles? The command, moreover, that the right cheek
should be smitten, is most incredible, since every one who
strikes, unless he happen to have some bodily defect,<a id='r959'></a><a href='#f959' class='c007'><sup>[959]</sup></a> smites
the <i>left</i> cheek with his <i>right</i> hand. And it is impossible to
take [literally, the statement] in the Gospel about the “offending”
of the right eye. For, to grant the possibility of one
being “offended” by the sense of sight, how, when there are
two eyes that see, should the blame be laid upon the right
eye? And who is there that, condemning himself for having
looked upon a woman to lust after her, would rationally
transfer the blame to the right eye alone, and throw <i>it</i> away?
The apostle, moreover, lays down the law, saying, “Is any
man called, being circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised.”<a id='r960'></a><a href='#f960' class='c007'><sup>[960]</sup></a>
In the first place, any one will see that he does
not utter these words in connection with the subject before
him. For, when laying down precepts on marriage and purity,
how will it not appear that he has introduced these words at
random?<a id='r961'></a><a href='#f961' class='c007'><sup>[961]</sup></a> But, in the second place, who will say that a
man does wrong who endeavours to become uncircumcised,
if that be possible, on account of the disgrace that is considered
by the multitude to attach to circumcision?</p>

<p class='c006'>All these statements have been made by us, in order to
show that the design of that divine power which gave us the
sacred Scriptures is, that we should not receive what is presented
by the letter alone (such things being sometimes not
true in their literal acceptation, but absurd and impossible),
but that certain things have been introduced into the actual
history and into the legislation that are useful in their literal
sense.<a id='r962'></a><a href='#f962' class='c007'><sup>[962]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>19. Let no one, however, entertain the suspicion that we
do not believe any history in Scripture to be real, because we
suspect certain events related in it not to have taken place;
or that no precepts of the law are to be taken literally, because
we consider certain of them, in which either the nature or
possibility of the case so requires, incapable of being observed;
or that we do not believe those predictions which were written
of the Saviour to have been fulfilled in a manner palpable to
the senses; or that His commandments are not to be literally
obeyed. We have therefore to state in answer, since we are
manifestly so of opinion, that the truth of the history may
and ought to be preserved in the majority of instances. For
who can deny that Abraham was buried in the double cave<a id='r963'></a><a href='#f963' class='c007'><sup>[963]</sup></a>
at Hebron, as well as Isaac and Jacob, and each of their
wives? Or who doubts that Shechem was given as a portion
to Joseph?<a id='r964'></a><a href='#f964' class='c007'><sup>[964]</sup></a> or that Jerusalem is the metropolis of Judea,
on which the temple of God was built by Solomon?—and
countless other statements. For the passages which hold
good in their historical acceptation are much more numerous
than those which contain a purely spiritual meaning. Then,
again, who would not maintain that the command to “honour
thy father and thy mother, that it may be well with thee,”<a id='r965'></a><a href='#f965' class='c007'><sup>[965]</sup></a> is
sufficient of itself without any spiritual meaning, and necessary
for those who observe it? especially when Paul also has confirmed
the command by repeating it in the same words. And
what need is there to speak of the prohibitions, “Thou shalt
not commit adultery,” “Thou shalt not steal,” “Thou shalt
not bear false witness,”<a id='r966'></a><a href='#f966' class='c007'><sup>[966]</sup></a> and others of the same kind? And
with respect to the precepts enjoined in the Gospels, no doubt
can be entertained that very many of these are to be literally
observed, as <i>e.g.</i> when our Lord says, “But I say unto you,
Swear not at all;”<a id='r967'></a><a href='#f967' class='c007'><sup>[967]</sup></a> and when He says, “Whosoever looketh
upon a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery with
her already in his heart;”<a id='r968'></a><a href='#f968' class='c007'><sup>[968]</sup></a> the admonitions also which are
found in the writings of the Apostle Paul, “Warn them that
are unruly, comfort the feeble-minded, support the weak, be
patient towards all men,”<a id='r969'></a><a href='#f969' class='c007'><sup>[969]</sup></a> and very many others. And yet
I have no doubt that an attentive reader will, in numerous
instances, hesitate whether this or that history can be considered
to be literally true or not; or whether this or that
precept ought to be observed according to the letter or no.
And therefore great pains and labour are to be employed,
until every reader reverentially understand that he is dealing
with divine and not human words inserted in the sacred books.</p>

<p class='c005'>19. But that no one may suppose that we assert respecting
the whole that no history is real<a id='r970'></a><a href='#f970' class='c007'><sup>[970]</sup></a> because a certain one is
not; and that no law is to be literally observed, because a
certain one, [understood] according to the letter, is absurd
or impossible; or that the statements regarding the Saviour
are not true in a manner perceptible to the senses;<a id='r971'></a><a href='#f971' class='c007'><sup>[971]</sup></a> or that
no commandment and precept of his ought to be obeyed;—we
have to answer that, with regard to certain things, it is
perfectly clear to us that the historical account is true; as
that Abraham was buried in the double cave at Hebron, as
also Isaac and Jacob, and the wives of each of them; and
that Shechem was given as a portion to Joseph;<a id='r972'></a><a href='#f972' class='c007'><sup>[972]</sup></a> and that
Jerusalem is the metropolis of Judea, in which the temple
of God was built by Solomon; and innumerable other statements.
For the passages that are true in their historical
meaning are much more numerous than those which are
interspersed with a purely spiritual signification. And again,
who would not say that the command which enjoins to
“honour thy father and thy mother, that it may be well
with thee,”<a id='r973'></a><a href='#f973' class='c007'><sup>[973]</sup></a> is useful, apart from all allegorical meaning,<a id='r974'></a><a href='#f974' class='c007'><sup>[974]</sup></a>
and ought to be observed, the Apostle Paul also having
employed these very same words? And what need is there
to speak of the [prohibitions], “Thou shalt not commit
adultery,” “Thou shalt not kill,” “Thou shalt not steal,”
“Thou shalt not bear false witness?”<a id='r975'></a><a href='#f975' class='c007'><sup>[975]</sup></a> And again, there
are commandments contained in the Gospel which admit of
no doubt whether they are to be observed according to the
letter or not; <i>e.g.</i> that which says, “But I say unto you,
Whoever is angry with his brother,”<a id='r976'></a><a href='#f976' class='c007'><sup>[976]</sup></a> and so on. And again,
“But I say unto you, Swear not at all.”<a id='r977'></a><a href='#f977' class='c007'><sup>[977]</sup></a> And in the
writings of the apostle the literal sense is to be retained:
“Warn them that are unruly, comfort the feeble-minded,
support the weak, be patient towards all men;”<a id='r978'></a><a href='#f978' class='c007'><sup>[978]</sup></a> although
it is possible for those ambitious of a deeper meaning to
retain the profundities of the wisdom of God, without setting
aside the commandment in its literal meaning.<a id='r979'></a><a href='#f979' class='c007'><sup>[979]</sup></a> The careful
[reader], however, will be in doubt<a id='r980'></a><a href='#f980' class='c007'><sup>[980]</sup></a> as to certain points,
being unable to show without long investigation whether this
history so deemed literally occurred or not, and whether the
literal meaning of this law is to be observed or not. And
therefore the exact reader must, in obedience to the Saviour’s
injunction to “search the Scriptures,”<a id='r981'></a><a href='#f981' class='c007'><sup>[981]</sup></a> carefully ascertain in
how far the literal meaning is true, and in how far impossible;
and so far as he can, trace out, by means of similar statements,
the meaning everywhere scattered through Scripture
of that which cannot be understood in a literal signification.</p>

<p class='c005'>20. The understanding, therefore, of holy Scripture which
we consider ought to be deservedly and consistently maintained,
is of the following kind. A certain nation is declared
by holy Scripture to have been chosen by God upon the
earth, which nation has received several names: for sometimes
the whole of it is termed Israel, and sometimes Jacob;
and it was divided by Jeroboam son of Nebat into two
portions; and the ten tribes which were formed under him
were called Israel, while the two remaining ones (with which
were united the tribe of Levi, and that which was descended
from the royal race of David) was named Judah. Now the
whole of the country possessed by that nation, which it had
received from God, was called Judea, in which was situated
the metropolis, Jerusalem; and it is called metropolis, being
as it were the mother of many cities, the names of which you
will frequently find mentioned here and there in the other
books of Scripture, but which are collected together into one
catalogue in the book of Joshua the son of Nun.<a id='r982'></a><a href='#f982' class='c007'><sup>[982]</sup></a></p>
<h4 class='c009'>FROM THE GREEK.</h4>
<p class='c005'>20. Since, therefore, as will be clear to those who read, the
connection taken literally is impossible, while the sense preferred<a id='r983'></a><a href='#f983' class='c007'><sup>[983]</sup></a>
is not impossible, but even the true one, it must be
our object to grasp the whole meaning, which connects the
account of what is literally impossible in an intelligible manner
with what is not only not impossible, but also historically true,
and which is allegorically understood, in respect of its not
having literally occurred.<a id='r984'></a><a href='#f984' class='c007'><sup>[984]</sup></a> For, with respect to holy Scripture,
our opinion is that the whole of it has a “spiritual,” but not
the whole a “bodily” meaning, because the bodily meaning
is in many places proved to be impossible. And therefore
great attention must be bestowed by the cautious reader on
the divine books, as being divine writings; the manner of
understanding which appears to us to be as follows:—The
Scriptures relate that God chose a certain nation upon the
earth, which they call by several names. For the whole of
this nation is termed Israel, and also Jacob. And when it
was divided in the times of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the
ten tribes related as being subject to him were called Israel;
and the remaining two, along with the tribe of Levi, being
ruled over by the descendants of David, were named Judah.
And the whole of the territory which the people of this
nation inhabited, being given them by God, receives the name
of Judah, the metropolis of which is Jerusalem,—a metropolis,
namely, of numerous cities, the names of which lie scattered
about in many other passages [of Scripture], but are
enumerated together in the book of Joshua the son of Nun.<a id='r985'></a><a href='#f985' class='c007'><sup>[985]</sup></a></p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>FROM THE LATIN.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c005'>21. This, then, being the state of the case, the holy apostle
desiring to elevate in some degree, and to raise our understanding
above the earth, says in a certain place, “Behold
Israel after the flesh;”<a id='r986'></a><a href='#f986' class='c007'><sup>[986]</sup></a> by which he certainly means that
there is another Israel which is not according to the flesh,
but according to the Spirit. And again in another passage,
“For they are not all Israelites who are of Israel.”<a id='r987'></a><a href='#f987' class='c007'><sup>[987]</sup></a></p>
<h4 class='c009'>FROM THE GREEK.</h4>
<p class='c005'>21. Such, then, being the state of the case, the apostle,
elevating our power of discernment [above the letter], says
somewhere, “Behold Israel after the flesh,”<a id='r988'></a><a href='#f988' class='c007'><sup>[988]</sup></a> as if there were
an Israel “according to the Spirit.” And in another place
he says, “For they who are the children of the flesh are not
the children of God;” nor are “they all Israel who are of
Israel;”<a id='r989'></a><a href='#f989' class='c007'><sup>[989]</sup></a> nor is “he a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is
that ‘circumcision’ which is outward in the flesh: but he is
a Jew who is one ‘inwardly;’ and circumcision is that of
the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter.”<a id='r990'></a><a href='#f990' class='c007'><sup>[990]</sup></a> For if the
judgment respecting the “Jew inwardly” be adopted, we
must understand that, as there is a “bodily” race of Jews,
so also is there a race of “Jews inwardly,” the soul having
acquired this nobility for certain mysterious reasons. Moreover,
there are many prophecies which predict regarding
Israel and Judah what is about to befall them. And do not
such promises as are written concerning them, in respect of
their being mean in expression, and manifesting no elevation
[of thought], nor anything worthy of the promise of God,
need a mystical interpretation? And if the “spiritual” promises
are announced by visible signs, then they to whom the
promises are made are not “corporeal.” And not to linger
over the point of the Jew who is a Jew “inwardly,” nor
over that of the Israelite according to the “inner man”—these
statements being sufficient for those who are not devoid
of understanding—we return to our subject, and say that
Jacob is the father of the twelve patriarchs, and they of the
rulers of the people; and these, again, of the other Israelites.
Do not, then, the “corporeal” Israelites refer their descent
to the rulers of the people, and the rulers of the people to the
patriarchs, and the patriarchs to Jacob, and those still higher
up; while are not the “spiritual” Israelites, of whom the “corporeal”
Israelites were the type, sprung from the families,
and the families from the tribes, and the tribes from some
one individual whose descent is not of a “corporeal” but of a
better kind,—he, too, being born of Isaac, and he of Abraham,—all
going back to Adam, whom the apostle declares to be
Christ? For every beginning of those families which have
relation to God as to the Father of all, took its commencement
lower down with Christ, who is next to the God and
Father of all,<a id='r991'></a><a href='#f991' class='c007'><sup>[991]</sup></a> being thus the Father of every soul, as Adam
is the father of all men. And if Eve also is intended by the
apostle to refer to the church, it is not surprising that Cain,
who was born of Eve, and all after him, whose descent goes
back to Eve, should be types of the church, inasmuch as in
a pre-eminent sense they are all descended from the church.</p>

  <h4 class='c009'>FROM THE LATIN.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c005'>22. Being taught, then, by him that there is one Israel
according to the flesh, and another according to the Spirit,
when the Saviour says, “I am not sent but to the lost sheep
of the house of Israel,”<a id='r992'></a><a href='#f992' class='c007'><sup>[992]</sup></a> we do not understand these words
as those do who savour of earthly things, <i>i.e.</i> the Ebionites,
who derive the appellation of “poor” from their very name
(for “Ebion” means “poor” in Hebrew<a id='r993'></a><a href='#f993' class='c007'><sup>[993]</sup></a>); but we understand
that there exists a race of souls which is termed “Israel,” as
is indicated by the interpretation of the name itself: for
Israel is interpreted to mean a “mind,” or “man seeing
God.” The apostle, again, makes a similar revelation respecting
Jerusalem, saying, “The Jerusalem which is above
is free, which is the mother of us all.”<a id='r994'></a><a href='#f994' class='c007'><sup>[994]</sup></a> And in another of
his epistles he says: “But ye are come unto mount Zion,
and to the city of the living God, and to the heavenly Jerusalem,
and to an innumerable company of angels, and to the
church of the first-born which is written in heaven.”<a id='r995'></a><a href='#f995' class='c007'><sup>[995]</sup></a> If,
then, there are certain souls in this world who are called
Israel, and a city in heaven which is called Jerusalem, it follows
that those cities which are said to belong to the nation
of Israel have the heavenly Jerusalem as their metropolis;
and that, agreeably to this, we understand as referring to
the whole of Judah (of which also we are of opinion that
the prophets have spoken in certain mystical narratives), any
predictions delivered either regarding Judea or Jerusalem,
or invasions of any kind, which the sacred histories declare
to have happened to Judea or Jerusalem. Whatever, then,
is either narrated or predicted of Jerusalem, must, if we
accept the words of Paul as those of Christ speaking in him,
be understood as spoken in conformity with his opinion regarding
that city which he calls the heavenly Jerusalem,
and all those places or cities which are said to be cities of
the holy land, of which Jerusalem is the metropolis. For
we are to suppose that it is from these very cities that the
Saviour, wishing to raise us to a higher grade of intelligence,
promises to those who have well managed the money entrusted
to them by Himself, that they are to have power over ten
or five cities. If, then, the prophecies delivered concerning
Judea, and Jerusalem, and Judah, and Israel, and Jacob, not
being understood by us in a carnal sense, signify certain
divine mysteries, it certainly follows that those prophecies also
which were delivered either concerning Egypt, or the Egyptians,
or Babylonia and the Babylonians, and Sidon and the
Sidonians, are not to be understood as spoken of that Egypt
which is situated on the earth, or of the earthly Babylon,
Tyre, or Sidon. Nor can those predictions which the prophet
Ezekiel delivered concerning Pharaoh king of Egypt,
apply to any man who may seem to have reigned over Egypt,
as the nature of the passage itself declares. In a similar
manner also, what is spoken of the prince of Tyre cannot be
understood of any man or king of Tyre. And how could we
possibly accept, as spoken of a man, what is related in many
passages of Scripture, and especially in Isaiah, regarding
Nebuchadnezzar? For he is not a man who is said to have
“fallen from heaven,” or who was “Lucifer,” or who “arose
in the morning.” But with respect to those predictions which
are found in Ezekiel concerning Egypt, such as that it is to
be destroyed in forty years, so that the foot of man should
not be found within it, and that it should suffer such devastation,
that throughout the whole land the blood of men should
rise to the knees, I do not know that any one possessed of
understanding could refer this to that earthly Egypt which
adjoins Ethiopia. But let us see whether it may not be
understood more fittingly in the following manner: viz. that
as there is a heavenly Jerusalem and Judea, and a nation
undoubtedly which inhabits it, and is named Israel; so also
it is possible that there are certain localities near to these
which may seem to be called either Egypt, or Babylon, or
Tyre, or Sidon, and that the princes of these places, and the
souls, if there be any, that inhabit them, are called Egyptians,
Babylonians, Tyrians, and Sidonians. From whom also,
according to the mode of life which they lead there, a sort of
captivity would seem to result, in consequence of which they
are said to have fallen from Judea into Babylonia or Egypt,
from a higher and better condition, or to have been scattered
into other countries.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>FROM THE GREEK.</h4>
<p class='c005'>22. Now, if the statements made to us regarding Israel,
and its tribes and its families, are calculated to impress
us, when the Saviour says, “I was not sent but to the lost
sheep of the house of Israel,”<a id='r996'></a><a href='#f996' class='c007'><sup>[996]</sup></a> we do not understand the expression
as the Ebionites do, who are poor in understanding
(deriving their name from the poverty of their intellect—Ebion
signifying “poor” in Hebrew), so as to suppose that
the Saviour came specially to the “carnal” Israelites; for
“they who are the children of the flesh are not the children
of God.”<a id='r997'></a><a href='#f997' class='c007'><sup>[997]</sup></a> Again, the apostle teaches regarding Jerusalem
as follows: “The Jerusalem which is above is free, which is
the mother of us all.”<a id='r998'></a><a href='#f998' class='c007'><sup>[998]</sup></a> And in another epistle: “But ye
are come unto mount Zion, and to the city of the living God,
to the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company
of angels, to the general assembly and to the church of the
first-born which are written in heaven.”<a id='r999'></a><a href='#f999' class='c007'><sup>[999]</sup></a> If, then, Israel is
among the race of souls,<a id='r1000'></a><a href='#f1000' class='c007'><sup>[1000]</sup></a> and if there is in heaven a city
of Jerusalem, it follows that the cities of Israel have for
their metropolis the heavenly Jerusalem, and it consequently
is the metropolis of all Judea. Whatever, therefore, is predicted
of Jerusalem, and spoken of it, if we listen to the
words of Paul as those of God, and of one who utters
wisdom, we must understand the Scriptures as speaking of
the heavenly city, and of the whole territory included within
the cities of the holy land. For perhaps it is to these
cities that the Saviour refers us, when to those who have
gained credit by having managed their “pounds” well, He
assigns the presidency over five or ten cities. If, therefore,
the prophecies relating to Judea, and Jerusalem, and Israel,
and Judah, and Jacob, not being understood by us in a
“carnal” sense, indicate some such mysteries [as already
mentioned], it will follow also that the predictions concerning
Egypt and the Egyptians, Babylon and the Babylonians,
Tyre and the Tyrians, Sidon and the Sidonians, or the other
nations, are spoken not only of these “bodily” Egyptians,
and Babylonians, and Tyrians, and Sidonians, but also of
their “spiritual” [counterparts]. For if there be “spiritual”
Israelites, it follows that there are also “spiritual” Egyptians
and Babylonians. For what is related in Ezekiel concerning
Pharaoh king of Egypt does not at all apply to the case of
a certain man who ruled or was said to rule over Egypt, as
will be evident to those who give it careful consideration.
Similarly, what is said about the ruler of Tyre cannot be
understood of a certain man who ruled over Tyre. And
what is said in many places, and especially in Isaiah, of
Nebuchadnezzar, cannot be explained of that individual.
For the man Nebuchadnezzar neither fell from heaven, nor
was he the morning star, nor did he arise upon the earth in
the morning. Nor would any man of understanding interpret
what is said in Ezekiel about Egypt—viz. that in forty years
it should be laid desolate, so that the footstep of man should
not be found thereon, and that the ravages of war should be
so great that the blood should run throughout the whole of it,
and rise to the knees—of that Egypt which is situated beside
the Ethiopians whose bodies are blackened by the sun.</p>

<p class='c005'>23. For perhaps as those who, departing this world in
virtue of that death which is common to all, are arranged, in
conformity with their actions and deserts—according as they
shall be deemed worthy—some in the place which is called
“hell,”<a id='r1001'></a><a href='#f1001' class='c007'><sup>[1001]</sup></a> others in the bosom of Abraham, and in different
localities or mansions; so also from those places, as if dying
there, if the expression can be used,<a id='r1002'></a><a href='#f1002' class='c007'><sup>[1002]</sup></a> do they come down
from the “upper world”<a id='r1003'></a><a href='#f1003' class='c007'><sup>[1003]</sup></a> to this “hell.” For that “hell”
to which the souls of the dead are conducted from this world,
is, I believe, on account of this distinction, called the “lower
hell” by Scripture, as is said in the book of Psalms: “Thou
hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell.”<a id='r1004'></a><a href='#f1004' class='c007'><sup>[1004]</sup></a> Every one,
accordingly, of those who descend to the earth is, according
to his deserts, or agreeably to the position which he occupied
there, ordained to be born in this world, in a different country,
or among a different nation, or in a different mode of life,
or surrounded by infirmities of a different kind, or to be
descended from religious parents, or parents who are not religious;
so that it may sometimes happen that an Israelite
descends among the Scythians, and a poor Egyptian is
brought down to Judea. And yet our Saviour came to
gather together the lost sheep of the house of Israel; and as
many of the Israelites did not accept His teaching, those who
belonged to the Gentiles were called. From which it will
appear to follow, that those prophecies which are delivered
to the individual nations ought to be referred rather to the
souls, and to their different heavenly mansions. Nay, the narratives
of the events which are said to have happened either
to the nation of Israel, or to Jerusalem, or to Judea, when
assailed by this or that nation, cannot in many instances be
understood as having actually<a id='r1005'></a><a href='#f1005' class='c007'><sup>[1005]</sup></a> occurred, and are much more
appropriate to those nations of souls who inhabit that heaven
which is said to pass away, or who even now are supposed
to be inhabitants of it.</p>

<p class='c006'>If now any one demand of us clear and distinct declarations
on these points out of holy Scripture, we must answer
that it was the design of the Holy Spirit, in those portions
which appear to relate the history of events, rather to cover
and conceal the meaning: in those passages, <i>e.g.</i>, where they
are said to go down into Egypt, or to be carried captive to
Babylonia, or when in these very countries some are said to
be brought to excessive humiliation, and to be placed under
bondage to their masters; while others, again, in these very
countries of their captivity, were held in honour and esteem,
so as to occupy positions of rank and power, and were
appointed to the government of provinces;—all which things,
as we have said, are kept hidden and covered in the narratives
of holy Scripture, because “the kingdom of heaven is
like a treasure hid in a field; which when a man findeth, he
hideth it, and for joy thereof goeth away and selleth all that
he hath, and buyeth that field.”<a id='r1006'></a><a href='#f1006' class='c007'><sup>[1006]</sup></a> By which similitude, consider
whether it be not pointed out that the very soil and
surface, so to speak, of Scripture—that is, the literal meaning—is
the field, filled with plants and flowers of all kinds;
while that deeper and profounder “spiritual” meaning are
the very hidden treasures of wisdom and knowledge which
the Holy Spirit by Isaiah calls the dark and invisible and
hidden treasures, for the finding out of which the divine
help is required: for God alone can burst the brazen gates
by which they are enclosed and concealed, and break in
pieces the iron bolts and levers by which access is prevented
to all those things which are written and concealed in Genesis
respecting the different kinds of souls, and of those seeds
and generations which either have a close connection with
Israel<a id='r1007'></a><a href='#f1007' class='c007'><sup>[1007]</sup></a> or are widely separated from his descendants; as well
as what is that descent of seventy souls into Egypt, which
seventy souls became in that land as the stars of heaven in
multitude. But as not all of them were the light of this
world—“for all who are of Israel are not Israel”<a id='r1008'></a><a href='#f1008' class='c007'><sup>[1008]</sup></a>—they
grow from being seventy souls to be an important people,<a id='r1009'></a><a href='#f1009' class='c007'><sup>[1009]</sup></a>
and as the “sand by the sea-shore innumerable.”</p>

<p class='c005'>23. And perhaps as those here, dying according to the
death common to all, are, in consequence of the deeds done
here, so arranged as to obtain different places according to
the proportion of their sins, if they should be deemed worthy
of the place called Hades;<a id='r1010'></a><a href='#f1010' class='c007'><sup>[1010]</sup></a> so those there dying, so to speak,
descend into this Hades, being judged deserving of different
abodes—better or worse—throughout all this space of earth,
and [of being descended] from parents of different kinds,<a id='r1011'></a><a href='#f1011' class='c007'><sup>[1011]</sup></a>
so that an Israelite may sometimes fall among Scythians,
and an Egyptian descend into Judea. And yet the Saviour
came to gather together the lost sheep of the house of Israel;
but many of the Israelites not having yielded to His teaching,
those from the Gentiles were called.... And these
points, as we suppose, have been concealed in the histories.
For “the kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hid in a field;
the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy
thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that
field.”<a id='r1012'></a><a href='#f1012' class='c007'><sup>[1012]</sup></a> Let us notice, then, whether the apparent and superficial
and obvious meaning of Scripture does not resemble a
field filled with plants of every kind, while the things lying
in it, and not visible to all, but buried, as it were, under the
plants that are seen, are the hidden treasures of wisdom
and knowledge; which the Spirit through Isaiah<a id='r1013'></a><a href='#f1013' class='c007'><sup>[1013]</sup></a> calls dark
and invisible and concealed, God alone being able to break
the brazen gates that conceal them, and to burst the iron bars
that are upon the gates, in order that all the statements in the
book of Genesis may be discovered which refer to the various
genuine kinds, and seeds, as it were, of souls, which stand
nearly related to Israel, or at a distance from it; and the
descent into Egypt of the seventy souls, that they may there
become as the “stars of heaven in multitude.” But since
not all who are of them are the light of the world—“for not
all who are of Israel are Israel”<a id='r1014'></a><a href='#f1014' class='c007'><sup>[1014]</sup></a>—they become from seventy
souls as the “sand that is beside the sea-shore innumerable.”</p>
<div class='tnotes'>

<p class='c006'>[Transcriber’s Note: This is the end of the Greek section in the original book.]</p>

<p class='c005'>24. This descent of the holy fathers into Egypt will
appear as granted to this world by the providence of God
for the illumination of others, and for the instruction of
the human race, that so by this means the souls of others
might be assisted in the work of enlightenment. For to
them was first granted the privilege of converse with God,
because theirs is the only race which is said to see God; this
being the meaning, by interpretation, of the word “Israel.”<a id='r1015'></a><a href='#f1015' class='c007'><sup>[1015]</sup></a>
And now it follows that, agreeably to this view, ought the
statement to be accepted and explained that Egypt was
scourged with ten plagues, to allow the people of God to
depart, or the account of what was done with the people in
the wilderness, or of the building of the tabernacle by means
of contributions from all the people, or of the wearing of the
priestly robes, or of the vessels of the public service, because,
as it is written, they truly contain within them the “shadow
and form of heavenly things.” For Paul openly says of
them, that “they serve unto the example and shadow of
heavenly things.”<a id='r1016'></a><a href='#f1016' class='c007'><sup>[1016]</sup></a> There are, moreover, contained in this
same law the precepts and institutions, according to which
men are to live in the holy land. Threatenings also are
held out as impending over those who shall transgress the
law; different kinds of purifications are moreover prescribed
for those who required purification, as being persons who
were liable to frequent pollution, that by means of these
they may arrive at last at that one purification after which
no further pollution is permitted. The very people are numbered,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>though not all; for the souls of children are not yet
old enough to be numbered according to the divine command:
nor are those souls who cannot become the head of another,
but are themselves subordinated to others as to a head, who
are called “women,” who certainly are not included in that
numbering which is enjoined by God; but they alone are
numbered who are called “men,” by which it might be
shown that the women could not be counted separately,<a id='r1017'></a><a href='#f1017' class='c007'><sup>[1017]</sup></a>
but were included in those called men. Those, however,
especially belong to the sacred number, who are prepared to
go forth to the battles of the Israelites, and are able to fight
against those public and private enemies<a id='r1018'></a><a href='#f1018' class='c007'><sup>[1018]</sup></a> whom the Father
subjects to the Son, who sits on His right hand that He may
destroy all principality and power, and by means of these
bands of His soldiery, who, being engaged in a warfare
for God, do not entangle themselves in secular business, He
may overturn the kingdom of His adversary; by whom the
shields of faith are borne, and the weapons of wisdom brandished;
among whom also the helmet of hope and salvation
gleams forth, and the breastplate of brightness fortifies the
breast that is filled with God. Such soldiers appear to me
to be indicated, and to be prepared for wars of this kind,
in those persons who in the sacred books are ordered by
God’s command to be numbered. But of these, by far the
more perfect and distinguished are shown to be those of
whom the very hairs of the head are said to be numbered.
Such, indeed, as were punished for their sins, whose bodies
fell in the wilderness, appear to possess a resemblance to
those who had made indeed no little progress, but who
could not at all, for various reasons, attain to the end of
perfection; because they are reported either to have murmured,
or to have worshipped idols, or to have committed
fornication, or to have done some evil work which the mind
ought not even to conceive. I do not consider the following
even to be without some mystical meaning,<a id='r1019'></a><a href='#f1019' class='c007'><sup>[1019]</sup></a> viz. that certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>[of the Israelites], possessing many flocks and animals, take
possession by anticipation of a country adapted for pasture
and the feeding of cattle, which was the very first that the
right hand of the Hebrews had secured in war.<a id='r1020'></a><a href='#f1020' class='c007'><sup>[1020]</sup></a> For,
making a request of Moses to receive this region, they are
divided off by the waters of the Jordan, and set apart from
any possession in the holy land. And this Jordan, according
to the form of heavenly things, may appear to water
and irrigate thirsty souls, and the senses that are adjacent
to it.<a id='r1021'></a><a href='#f1021' class='c007'><sup>[1021]</sup></a> In connection with which, even this statement does
not appear superfluous, that Moses indeed hears from God
what is described in the book of Leviticus, while in Deuteronomy
it is the people that are the auditors of Moses, and
who learn from him what they could not hear from God.
For as Deuteronomy is called, as it were, the second law,
which to some will appear to convey this signification, that
when the first law which was given through Moses had
come to an end, so a second legislation seems to have been
enacted, which was specially transmitted by Moses to his
successor Joshua, who is certainly believed to embody a
type<a id='r1022'></a><a href='#f1022' class='c007'><sup>[1022]</sup></a> of our Saviour, by whose second law—that is, the
precepts of the Gospel—all things are brought to perfection.</p>

<p class='c006'>25. We have to see, however, whether this deeper meaning
may not perhaps be indicated, viz. that as in Deuteronomy
the legislation is made known with greater clearness and
distinctness than in those books which were first written, so
also by that advent of the Saviour which He accomplished
in His state of humiliation, when He assumed the form of a
servant, that more celebrated and renowned second advent
in the glory of His Father may not be pointed out, and in
it the types of Deuteronomy may be fulfilled, when in the
kingdom of heaven all the saints shall live according to the
laws of the everlasting gospel; and as in His coming now
He fulfilled that law which has a shadow of good things to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>come, so also by that [future] glorious advent will be fulfilled
and brought to perfection the shadows of the present
advent. For thus spake the prophet regarding it: “The
breath of our countenance, Christ the Lord, to whom we said,
that under Thy shadow we shall live among the nations;”<a id='r1023'></a><a href='#f1023' class='c007'><sup>[1023]</sup></a>
at the time, viz., when He will more worthily transfer all the
saints from a temporal to an everlasting gospel, according
to the designation, employed by John in the Apocalypse, of
“an everlasting gospel.”<a id='r1024'></a><a href='#f1024' class='c007'><sup>[1024]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>26. But let it be sufficient for us in all these matters to
adapt our understanding to the rule of religion, and so to
think of the words of the Holy Spirit as not to deem the
language the ornate composition of feeble human eloquence,
but to hold, according to the scriptural statement, that “all
the glory of the King is within,”<a id='r1025'></a><a href='#f1025' class='c007'><sup>[1025]</sup></a> and that the treasure of
divine meaning is enclosed within the frail vessel of the
common letter. And if any curious reader were still to ask
an explanation of individual points, let him come and hear,
along with ourselves, how the Apostle Paul, seeking to
penetrate by help of the Holy Spirit, who searches even the
“deep things” of God, into the depths of divine wisdom and
knowledge, and yet, unable to reach the end, so to speak,
and to come to a thorough knowledge, exclaims in despair
and amazement, “Oh the depth of the riches of the knowledge
and wisdom of God!”<a id='r1026'></a><a href='#f1026' class='c007'><sup>[1026]</sup></a> Now, that it was from despair
of attaining a perfect understanding that he uttered this
exclamation, listen to his own words: “How unsearchable
are God’s judgments! and His ways, how past finding out!”<a id='r1027'></a><a href='#f1027' class='c007'><sup>[1027]</sup></a>
For he did not say that God’s judgments were difficult to
discover, but that they were altogether inscrutable; nor that
it was [simply] difficult to trace out His ways, but that they
were altogether past finding out. For however far a man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>may advance in his investigations, and how great soever the
progress that he may make by unremitting study, assisted
even by the grace of God, and with his mind enlightened,
he will not be able to attain to the end of those things which
are the object of his inquiries. Nor can any created mind
deem it possible in any way to attain a full comprehension
[of things]; but after having discovered certain of the objects
of its research, it sees again others which have still to be
sought out. And even if it should succeed in mastering
these, it will see again many others succeeding them which
must form the subject of investigation. And on this account,
therefore, Solomon, the wisest of men, beholding by
his wisdom the nature of things, says, “I said, I will become
wise; and wisdom herself was made far from me, far further
than it was; and a profound depth who shall find?”<a id='r1028'></a><a href='#f1028' class='c007'><sup>[1028]</sup></a> Isaiah
also, knowing that the beginnings of things could not be discovered
by a mortal nature, and not even by those natures
which, although more divine than human, were nevertheless
themselves created or formed; knowing then, that by none
of these could either the beginning or the end be discovered,
says, “Tell the former things which have been, and we
know that ye are gods; or announce what are the last
things, and then we shall see that ye are gods.”<a id='r1029'></a><a href='#f1029' class='c007'><sup>[1029]</sup></a> For my
Hebrew teacher also used thus to teach, that as the beginning
or end of all things could be comprehended by no one, save
only our Lord Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit, so under
the form of a vision Isaiah spake of two seraphim alone,
who with two wings cover the countenance of God, and
with two His feet, and with two do fly, calling to each other
alternately, and saying, “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God
of Sabaoth; the whole earth is full of Thy glory.”<a id='r1030'></a><a href='#f1030' class='c007'><sup>[1030]</sup></a> That the
seraphim alone have both their wings over the face of God,
and over His feet, we venture to declare as meaning that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>neither the hosts of holy angels, nor the “holy seats,” nor
the “dominions,” nor the “principalities,” nor the “powers,”
can fully understand the beginning of all things, and the
limits of the universe. But we are to understand that those
“saints” whom the Spirit has enrolled, and the “virtues,”
approach very closely to those very beginnings, and attain to
a height which the others cannot reach; and yet whatever it
be that these “virtues” have learned through revelation from
the Son of God and from the Holy Spirit—and they will
certainly be able to learn very much, and those of higher
rank much more than those of a lower—nevertheless it is
impossible for them to comprehend all things, according to
the statement, “The most part of the works of God are hid.”<a id='r1031'></a><a href='#f1031' class='c007'><sup>[1031]</sup></a>
And therefore also it is to be desired that every one, according
to his strength, should ever stretch out to those things
that are before, “forgetting the things that are behind,”
both to better works and to a clearer apprehension and
understanding, through Jesus Christ our Saviour, to whom
be glory for ever!</p>

<p class='c006'>27. Let every one, then, who cares for truth, be little
concerned about words and language, seeing that in every
nation there prevails a different usage of speech; but let
him rather direct his attention to the meaning conveyed by
the words, than to the nature of the words that convey
the meaning, especially in matters of such importance and
difficulty: as, <i>e.g.</i>, when it is an object of investigation
whether there is any “substance” in which neither colour,
nor form, nor touch, nor magnitude is to be understood as
existing visible to the mind alone, which any one names as
he pleases; for the Greeks call such <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀσώματον</span>, <i>i.e.</i> “incorporeal,”
while holy Scripture declares it to be “invisible,”
for Paul calls Christ the “image of the invisible God,” and
says again, that by Christ were created all things “visible
and invisible.” And by this it is declared that there are,
among created things, certain “substances” that are, according
to their peculiar nature, invisible. But although these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>are not themselves “corporeal,” they nevertheless make use
of bodies, while they are themselves better than any bodily
substances. But that “substance” of the Trinity which is
the beginning and cause of all things, “from which are all
things, and through which are all things, and in which are
all things,” cannot be believed to be either a body or in a
body, but is altogether incorporeal. And now let it suffice to
have spoken briefly on these points (although in a digression,
caused by the nature of the subject), in order to show that
there are certain things, the meaning of which cannot be
unfolded at all by any words of human language, but which
are made known more through simple apprehension than
by any properties of words. And under this rule must be
brought also the understanding of the sacred Scripture, in
order that its statements may be judged not according to the
worthlessness of the letter, but according to the divinity of
the Holy Spirit, by whose inspiration they were caused to
be written.</p>
<p class='c012'>SUMMARY [OF DOCTRINE] REGARDING THE FATHER, THE
SON, AND THE HOLY SPIRIT, AND THE OTHER TOPICS
DISCUSSED IN THE PRECEDING PAGES.</p>
<p class='c005'>28. It is now time, after the rapid consideration which to
the best of our ability we have given to the topics discussed,
to recapitulate, by way of summing up what we have said in
different places, the individual points, and first of all to restate
our conclusions regarding the Father, and the Son, and the
Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class='c006'>Seeing God the Father is invisible and inseparable from
the Son, the Son is not generated from Him by “prolation,”
as some suppose. For if the Son be a “prolation” of the
Father (the term “prolation” being used to signify such a
generation as that of animals or men usually is), then, of
necessity, both He who “prolated” and He who <i>was</i> “prolated”
are corporeal. For we do not say, as the heretics suppose, that
some part of the substance of God was converted into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>Son, or that the Son was procreated by the Father out of
things non-existent,<a id='r1032'></a><a href='#f1032' class='c007'><sup>[1032]</sup></a> <i>i.e.</i> beyond His own substance, so that
there once was a time when He did not exist; but, putting
away all corporeal conceptions, we say that the Word and
Wisdom was begotten out of the invisible and incorporeal without
any corporeal feeling, as if it were an act of the will proceeding
from the understanding. Nor, seeing He is called
the Son of [His] love, will it appear absurd if in this way He
be called also the Son of [His] will. Nay, John also indicates
that “God is Light,”<a id='r1033'></a><a href='#f1033' class='c007'><sup>[1033]</sup></a> and Paul also declares that the Son
is the splendour of everlasting light.<a id='r1034'></a><a href='#f1034' class='c007'><sup>[1034]</sup></a> As light, accordingly,
could never exist without splendour, so neither can the Son
be understood to exist without the Father; for He is called
the “express image of His person,” and the Word and
Wisdom. How, then, can it be asserted that there once was
a time when He was not the Son? For that is nothing else
than to say that there was once a time when He was not the
Truth, nor the Wisdom, nor the Life, although in all these
He is judged to be the perfect essence of God the Father;
for these things cannot be severed from Him, or even be
separated from His essence. And although these qualities
are said to be many in understanding,<a id='r1035'></a><a href='#f1035' class='c007'><sup>[1035]</sup></a> yet in their nature and
essence they are one, and in them is the fulness of divinity.
Now this expression which we employ—“that there never
was a time when He did not exist”—is to be understood with
an allowance. For these very words “when” or “never”
have a meaning that relates to time, whereas the statements
made regarding Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are to be
understood as transcending all time, all ages, and all eternity.
For it is the Trinity alone which exceeds the comprehension
not only of temporal but even of eternal intelligence; while
other things which are not included in it<a id='r1036'></a><a href='#f1036' class='c007'><sup>[1036]</sup></a> are to be measured
by times and ages. This Son of God, then, in respect of the
Word being God, which was in the beginning with God, no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>one will logically suppose to be contained in any place; nor
yet in respect of His being “Wisdom,” or “Truth,” or the
“Life,” or “Righteousness,” or “Sanctification,” or “Redemption:”
for all these properties do not require space to
be able to act or to operate, but each one of them is to be
understood as meaning those individuals who participate in
His virtue and working.</p>

<p class='c006'>29. Now, if any one were to say that, through those who
are partakers of the “Word” of God, or of His “Wisdom,”
or His “Truth,” or His “Life,” the Word and Wisdom itself
appeared to be contained in a place, we should have to say
to him in answer, that there is no doubt that Christ, in respect
of being the “Word” or “Wisdom,” or all other things, was
in Paul, and that he therefore said, “Do you seek a proof
of Christ speaking in me?”<a id='r1037'></a><a href='#f1037' class='c007'><sup>[1037]</sup></a> and again, “I live, yet not I,
but Christ liveth in me.”<a id='r1038'></a><a href='#f1038' class='c007'><sup>[1038]</sup></a> Seeing, then, He was in Paul,
who will doubt that He was in a similar manner in Peter
and in John, and in each one of the saints; and not only in
those who are upon the earth, but in those also who are in
heaven? For it is absurd to say that Christ was in Peter
and in Paul, but not in Michael the archangel, nor in Gabriel.
And from this it is distinctly shown that the divinity of the
Son of God was not shut up in some place; otherwise it
would have been in it only, and not in another. But since,
in conformity with the majesty of its incorporeal nature,
it is confined to no place; so, again, it cannot be understood
to be wanting in any. But this is understood to be the
sole difference, that although He is in different individuals
as we have said—as Peter, or Paul, or Michael, or Gabriel—He
is not in a similar way in all beings whatever. For He
is more fully and clearly, and, so to speak, more openly in
archangels than in other holy men.<a id='r1039'></a><a href='#f1039' class='c007'><sup>[1039]</sup></a> And this is evident
from the statement, that when all who are saints have arrived
at the summit of perfection, they are said to be made like,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>or equal to, the angels, agreeably to the declaration in the
Gospels.<a id='r1040'></a><a href='#f1040' class='c007'><sup>[1040]</sup></a> Whence it is clear that Christ is in each individual
in as great a degree as the amount of his deserts allows.<a id='r1041'></a><a href='#f1041' class='c007'><sup>[1041]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>30. Having, then, briefly restated these points regarding
the nature of the Trinity, it follows that we notice shortly
this statement also, that “by the Son” are said to be created
“all things that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible
and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities,
or powers: all things were created by Him, and
for Him; and He is before all, and all things consist by
Him, who is the head.”<a id='r1042'></a><a href='#f1042' class='c007'><sup>[1042]</sup></a> In conformity with which John
also in his Gospel says: “All things were created by Him;
and without Him was not anything made.”<a id='r1043'></a><a href='#f1043' class='c007'><sup>[1043]</sup></a> And David,
intimating that the mystery of the entire Trinity was [concerned]
in the creation of all things, says: “By the Word of
the Lord were the heavens made; and all the host of them
by the Spirit of His mouth.”<a id='r1044'></a><a href='#f1044' class='c007'><sup>[1044]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>After these points we shall appropriately remind [the
reader] of the bodily advent and incarnation of the only-begotten
Son of God, with respect to whom we are not to
suppose that all the majesty of His divinity is confined within
the limits of His slender body, so that all the “word” of
God, and His “wisdom,” and “essential truth,” and “life,”
was either rent asunder from the Father, or restrained and
confined within the narrowness of His bodily person, and is
not to be considered to have operated anywhere besides; but
the cautious acknowledgment of a religious man ought to be
between the two, so that it ought neither to be believed that
anything of divinity was wanting in Christ, nor that any
separation at all was made from the essence of the Father,
which is everywhere. For some such meaning seems to be
indicated by John the Baptist, when he said to the multitude
in the bodily absence of Jesus, “There standeth one among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>you whom ye know not: He it is who cometh after me, the
latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose.”<a id='r1045'></a><a href='#f1045' class='c007'><sup>[1045]</sup></a> For it
certainly could not be said of Him, who was absent, so far as
His bodily presence is concerned, that He was standing in
the midst of those among whom the Son of God was not
bodily present.</p>

<p class='c006'>31. Let no one, however, suppose that by this we affirm
that some portion of the divinity of the Son of God was in
Christ, and that the remaining portion was elsewhere or
everywhere, which may be the opinion of those who are ignorant
of the nature of an incorporeal and invisible essence.
For it is impossible to speak of the parts of an incorporeal
being, or to make any division of them; but He is in all
things, and through all things, and above all things, in the
manner in which we have spoken above, <i>i.e.</i> in the manner
in which He is understood to be either “wisdom,” or the
“word,” or the “life,” or the “truth,” by which method
of understanding all confinement of a local kind is undoubtedly
excluded. The Son of God, then, desiring for
the salvation of the human race to appear unto men, and
to sojourn among them, assumed not only a human body, as
some suppose, but also a soul resembling our souls indeed in
nature, but in will and power<a id='r1046'></a><a href='#f1046' class='c007'><sup>[1046]</sup></a> resembling Himself, and such
as might unfailingly accomplish all the desires and arrangements
of the “word” and “wisdom.” Now, that He had a
soul,<a id='r1047'></a><a href='#f1047' class='c007'><sup>[1047]</sup></a> is most clearly shown by the Saviour in the Gospels,
when He said, “No man taketh my life from me, but I lay
it down of myself. I have power to lay down my life, and
I have power to take it again.”<a id='r1048'></a><a href='#f1048' class='c007'><sup>[1048]</sup></a> And again, “My soul is
sorrowful even unto death.”<a id='r1049'></a><a href='#f1049' class='c007'><sup>[1049]</sup></a> And again, “Now is my soul
troubled.”<a id='r1050'></a><a href='#f1050' class='c007'><sup>[1050]</sup></a> For the “Word” of God is not to be understood
to be a “sorrowful and troubled” soul, because with
the authority of divinity He says, “I have power to lay
down my life.” Nor yet do we assert that the Son of God
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>was in that soul as He was in the soul of Paul or Peter and
the other saints, in whom Christ is believed to speak as He
does in Paul. But regarding all these we are to hold, as
Scripture declares, “No one is clean from filthiness, not even
if his life lasted but a single day.”<a id='r1051'></a><a href='#f1051' class='c007'><sup>[1051]</sup></a> But this soul which
was in Jesus, before it knew the evil, selected the good; and
because He loved righteousness, and hated iniquity, therefore
God “anointed Him with the oil of gladness above His
fellows.”<a id='r1052'></a><a href='#f1052' class='c007'><sup>[1052]</sup></a> He is anointed, then, with the oil of gladness
when He is united to the “word” of God in a stainless
union, and by this means alone of all souls was incapable
of sin, because it was capable of [receiving] well and fully
the Son of God; and therefore also it is one with Him, and
is named by His titles, and is called Jesus Christ, by whom
all things are said to be made. Of which soul, seeing it had
received into itself the whole wisdom of God, and the truth,
and the life, I think that the apostle also said this: “Our
life is hidden with Christ in God; but when Christ, who is
our life, shall appear, then shall we also appear with Him
in glory.”<a id='r1053'></a><a href='#f1053' class='c007'><sup>[1053]</sup></a> For what other Christ can be here understood,
who is said to be hidden in God, and who is afterwards to
appear, except Him who is related to have been anointed
with the oil of gladness, <i>i.e.</i> to have been filled with God
essentially,<a id='r1054'></a><a href='#f1054' class='c007'><sup>[1054]</sup></a> in whom He is now said to be hidden? For on
this account is Christ proposed as an example to all believers,
because as He always, even before He knew evil at all, selected
the good, and loved righteousness, and hated iniquity,
and therefore God anointed Him with the oil of gladness; so
also ought each one, after a lapse or sin, to cleanse himself
from his stains, making Him his example, and, taking Him as
the guide of his journey, enter upon the steep way of virtue,
that so perchance by this means, as far as possible we may,
by imitating Him, be made partakers of the divine nature,
according to the words of Scripture: “He that saith that he
believeth in Christ, ought so to walk, as He also walked.”<a id='r1055'></a><a href='#f1055' class='c007'><sup>[1055]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>This “word,” then, and this “wisdom,” by the imitation
of which we are said to be either wise or rational [beings],
becomes “all things to all men, that it may gain all;” and
because it is made weak, it is therefore said of it, “Though
He was crucified through weakness, yet He liveth by the
power of God.”<a id='r1056'></a><a href='#f1056' class='c007'><sup>[1056]</sup></a> Finally, to the Corinthians who were
weak, Paul declares that he “knew nothing, save Jesus
Christ, and Him crucified.”<a id='r1057'></a><a href='#f1057' class='c007'><sup>[1057]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>32. Some, indeed, would have the following language of
the apostle applied to the soul itself, as soon as it had assumed
flesh from Mary,<a id='r1058'></a><a href='#f1058' class='c007'><sup>[1058]</sup></a> viz., “Who, being in the form of God,
thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but divested
Himself [of His glory],<a id='r1059'></a><a href='#f1059' class='c007'><sup>[1059]</sup></a> taking upon Himself the form of a
servant;”<a id='r1060'></a><a href='#f1060' class='c007'><sup>[1060]</sup></a> since He undoubtedly restored it to the form of
God by means of better examples and training, and recalled
it to that fulness of which He had divested Himself.</p>

<p class='c006'>As now by participation in the Son of God one is adopted
as a son,<a id='r1061'></a><a href='#f1061' class='c007'><sup>[1061]</sup></a> and by participating in that wisdom which is in
God is rendered wise, so also by participation in the Holy
Spirit is a man rendered holy and spiritual. For it is one and
the same thing to have a share in the Holy Spirit, which is
[the Spirit] of the Father and the Son, since the nature of
the Trinity is one and incorporeal. And what we have said
regarding the participation of the soul is to be understood
of angels and heavenly powers in a similar way as of souls,
because every rational creature needs a participation in the
Trinity.</p>

<p class='c006'>Respecting also the plan of this visible world—seeing one
of the most important questions usually raised is as to the
manner of its existence—we have spoken to the best of our
ability in the preceding pages, for the sake of those who are
accustomed to seek the grounds of their belief in our religion,
and also for those who stir against us heretical questions, and
who are accustomed to bandy about<a id='r1062'></a><a href='#f1062' class='c007'><sup>[1062]</sup></a> the word “matter,” which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>they have not yet been able to understand; of which subject
I now deem it necessary briefly to remind [the reader].</p>

<p class='c006'>33. And, in the first place, it is to be noted that we have
nowhere found in the canonical Scriptures,<a id='r1063'></a><a href='#f1063' class='c007'><sup>[1063]</sup></a> up to the present
time, the word “matter” used for that substance which is
said to underlie bodies. For in the expression of Isaiah,
“And he shall devour <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὕλη</span>,” <i>i.e.</i> matter, “like hay,”<a id='r1064'></a><a href='#f1064' class='c007'><sup>[1064]</sup></a> when
speaking of those who were appointed to undergo their
punishments, the word “matter” was used instead of “sins.”
And if this word “matter” should happen to occur in any
other passage, it will never be found, in my opinion, to have
the signification of which we are now in quest, unless perhaps
in the book which is called the Wisdom of Solomon, a work
which is certainly not esteemed authoritative by all. In
that book, however, we find written as follows: “For Thy
almighty hand, that made the world out of shapeless matter,
wanted not means to send among them a multitude of bears
and fierce lions.”<a id='r1065'></a><a href='#f1065' class='c007'><sup>[1065]</sup></a> Very many, indeed, are of opinion that
the matter of which things are made is itself signified in the
language used by Moses in the beginning of Genesis: “In
the beginning God made heaven and earth; and the earth was
invisible, and not arranged:”<a id='r1066'></a><a href='#f1066' class='c007'><sup>[1066]</sup></a> for by the words “invisible
and not arranged” Moses would seem to mean nothing else
than shapeless matter. But if this be truly matter, it is
clear then that the original elements of bodies<a id='r1067'></a><a href='#f1067' class='c007'><sup>[1067]</sup></a> are not
incapable of change. For those who posited “atoms”—either
those particles which are incapable of subdivision,
or those which are subdivided into equal parts—or any one
element, as the principles of bodily things, could not posit
the word “matter” in the proper sense of the term among
the first principles of things. For if they will have it that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>matter underlies every body—a substance convertible or
changeable, or divisible in all its parts—they will not, as
is proper, assert that it exists without qualities. And with
them we agree, for we altogether deny that matter ought to
be spoken of as “unbegotten” or “uncreated,” agreeably to
our former statements, when we pointed out that from water,
and earth, and air or heat, different kinds of fruits were produced
by different kinds of trees; or when we showed that
fire, and air, and water, and earth were alternately converted
into each other, and that one element was resolved into
another by a kind of mutual consanguinity; and also when
we proved that from the food either of men or animals the
substance of the flesh was derived, or that the moisture of
the natural seed was converted into solid flesh and bones;—all
which go to prove that the substance of the body is
changeable, and may pass from one quality into all others.</p>

<p class='c006'>34. Nevertheless we must not forget that a substance
never exists without a quality, and that it is by an act of
the understanding alone that this [substance] which underlies
bodies, and which is capable of quality, is discovered to
be matter. Some indeed, in their desire to investigate these
subjects more profoundly, have ventured to assert that bodily
nature<a id='r1068'></a><a href='#f1068' class='c007'><sup>[1068]</sup></a> is nothing else than qualities. For if hardness and
softness, heat and cold, moisture and aridity, be qualities;
and if, when these or other [qualities] of this sort be cut
away, nothing else is understood to remain, then all things
will appear to be “qualities.” And therefore also those
persons who make these assertions have endeavoured to maintain,
that since all who say that matter was uncreated will
admit that qualities were created by God, it may be in this
way shown that even according to them matter was not
uncreated; since qualities constitute everything, and these
are declared by all without contradiction to have been made
by God. Those, again, who would make out that qualities
are superimposed from without upon a certain underlying
matter, make use of illustrations of this kind: <i>e.g.</i> Paul undoubtedly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>is either silent, or speaks, or watches, or sleeps, or
maintains a certain attitude of body; for he is either in a
sitting, or standing, or recumbent position. For these are
“accidents” belonging to men, without which they are almost
never found. And yet our conception of man does not lay
down any of these things as a definition of him; but we so
understand and regard him by their means, that we do not at
all take into account the reason of his [particular] condition
either in watching, or in sleeping, or in speaking, or in
keeping silence, or in any other action that must necessarily
happen to men.<a id='r1069'></a><a href='#f1069' class='c007'><sup>[1069]</sup></a> If any one, then, can regard Paul as being
without all these things which are capable of happening, he
will in the same way also be able to understand this underlying
[substance] without qualities. When, then, our mind
puts away all qualities from its conception, and gazes, so
to speak, upon the underlying element alone, and keeps its
attention closely upon it, without any reference to the softness
or hardness, or heat or cold, or humidity or aridity of
the substance, then by means of this somewhat simulated
process of thought<a id='r1070'></a><a href='#f1070' class='c007'><sup>[1070]</sup></a> it will appear to behold matter clear from
qualities of every kind.</p>

<p class='c006'>35. But some one will perhaps inquire whether we can
obtain out of Scripture any grounds for such an understanding
of the subject. Now I think some such view is indicated
in the Psalms, when the prophet says, “Mine eyes
have seen thine imperfection;”<a id='r1071'></a><a href='#f1071' class='c007'><sup>[1071]</sup></a> by which the mind of the
prophet, examining with keener glance the first principles of
things, and separating in thought and imagination only between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>matter and its qualities, perceived the imperfection of
God, which certainly is understood to be perfected by the
addition of qualities. Enoch also, in his book, speaks as
follows: “I have walked on even to imperfection;”<a id='r1072'></a><a href='#f1072' class='c007'><sup>[1072]</sup></a> which
expression I consider may be understood in a similar manner,
viz. that the mind of the prophet proceeded in its scrutiny
and investigation of all visible things, until it arrived at that
first beginning in which it beheld imperfect matter [existing]
without “qualities.” For it is written in the same book of
Enoch, “I beheld the whole of matter;”<a id='r1073'></a><a href='#f1073' class='c007'><sup>[1073]</sup></a> which is so understood
as if he had said: “I have clearly seen all the divisions
of matter which are broken up from one into each individual
species either of men, or animals, or of the sky, or of the
sun, or of all other things in this world.” After these points,
now, we proved to the best of our power in the preceding
pages that all things which exist were made by God, and
that there was nothing which was not made, save the nature
of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit; and that
God, who is by nature good, desiring to have those upon whom
He might confer benefits, and who might rejoice in receiving
His benefits, created creatures worthy [of this], <i>i.e.</i> who were
capable of receiving Him in a worthy manner, who, He says,
are also begotten by Him as his sons. He made all things,
moreover, by number and measure. For there is nothing
before God without either limit or measure. For by His
power He comprehends all things, and He Himself is comprehended
by the strength of no created thing, because that
nature is known to itself alone. For the Father alone
knoweth the Son, and the Son alone knoweth the Father,
and the Holy Spirit alone searcheth even the deep things of
God. All created things, therefore, <i>i.e.</i> either the number
of rational beings or the measure of bodily matter, are
distinguished by Him as being within a certain number or
measurement; since, as it was necessary for an intellectual
nature to employ bodies, and this nature is shown to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>changeable and convertible by the very condition of its being
created (for what did not exist, but began to exist, is said by
this very circumstance to be of mutable nature), it can have
neither goodness nor wickedness as an essential, but only as
an accidental attribute of its being. Seeing, then, as we
have said, that rational nature was mutable and changeable,
so that it made use of a different bodily covering of this or
that sort of quality, according to its merits, it was necessary,
as God foreknew there would be diversities in souls or
spiritual powers, that He should create also a bodily nature
the qualities of which might be changed at the will of the
Creator into all that was required. And this bodily nature
must last as long as those things which require it as a covering:
for there will be always rational natures which need a
bodily covering; and there will therefore always be a bodily
nature whose coverings must necessarily be used by rational
creatures, unless some one be able to demonstrate by arguments
that a rational nature can live without a body. But
how difficult—nay, how almost impossible—this is for our
understanding, we have shown in the preceding pages, in our
discussion of the individual topics.</p>

<p class='c006'>36. It will not, I consider, be opposed to the nature of
our undertaking, if we restate with all possible brevity our
opinions on the immortality of rational natures. Every one
who participates in anything, is unquestionably of one essence
and nature with him who is partaker of the same thing. For
example, as all eyes participate in the light, so accordingly
all eyes which partake of the light are of one nature; but
although every eye partakes of the light, yet, inasmuch as one
sees more clearly, and another more obscurely, every eye does
not equally share in the light. And again, all hearing receives
voice or sound, and therefore all hearing is of one nature;
but each one hears more rapidly or more slowly, according as
the quality of his hearing is clear and sound. Let us pass
now from these sensuous illustrations to the consideration of
intellectual things. Every mind which partakes of intellectual
light ought undoubtedly to be of one nature with every mind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>which partakes in a similar manner of intellectual light. If
the heavenly virtues, then, partake of intellectual light, <i>i.e.</i> of
divine nature, because they participate in wisdom and holiness,
and if human souls have partaken of the same light and
wisdom, and thus are mutually of one nature and of one
essence,—then, since the heavenly virtues are incorruptible
and immortal, the essence of the human soul will also be
immortal and incorruptible. And not only so, but because
the nature of Father, and Son, and Holy Spirit, of whose
intellectual light alone all created things have a share, is
incorruptible and eternal, it is altogether consistent and
necessary that every substance which partakes of that eternal
nature should last for ever, and be incorruptible and eternal,
so that the eternity of divine goodness may be understood
also in this respect, that they who obtain its benefits are also
eternal. But as, in the instances referred to, a diversity in
the participation of the light was observed, when the glance
of the beholder was described as being duller or more acute,
so also a diversity is to be noted in the participation of Father,
Son, and Holy Spirit, varying with the degree of zeal or
capacity of mind. If such were not the case,<a id='r1074'></a><a href='#f1074' class='c007'><sup>[1074]</sup></a> we have to
consider whether it would not seem to be an act of impiety to
say that the mind which is capable of [receiving] God should
admit of a destruction of its essence;<a id='r1075'></a><a href='#f1075' class='c007'><sup>[1075]</sup></a> as if the very fact
that it is able to feel and understand God could not suffice
for its perpetual existence, especially since, if even through
neglect the mind fall away from a pure and complete reception
of God, it nevertheless contains within it certain seeds
of restoration and renewal to a better understanding, seeing
the “inner,” which is also called the “rational” man, is
renewed after “the image and likeness of God, who created
him.” And therefore the prophet says, “All the ends of the
earth shall remember, and turn unto the Lord; and all the
kindreds of the nations shall worship before Thee.”<a id='r1076'></a><a href='#f1076' class='c007'><sup>[1076]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>37. If any one, indeed, venture to ascribe essential corruption
to him who was made after the image and likeness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>of God, then, in my opinion, this impious charge extends
even to the Son of God Himself, for He is called in Scripture
the image of God.<a id='r1077'></a><a href='#f1077' class='c007'><sup>[1077]</sup></a> Or he who holds this opinion would
certainly impugn the authority of Scripture, which says that
man was made in the image of God; and in him are manifestly
to be discovered traces of the divine image, not by any appearance
of the bodily frame, which is corruptible, but by mental
wisdom, by justice, moderation, virtue, wisdom, discipline; in
fine, by the whole band of virtues, which are innate in the
essence of God, and which may enter into man by diligence
and imitation of God; as the Lord also intimates in the
Gospel, when He says, “Be ye therefore merciful, as your
Father also is merciful;”<a id='r1078'></a><a href='#f1078' class='c007'><sup>[1078]</sup></a> and, “Be ye perfect, even as your
Father also is perfect.”<a id='r1079'></a><a href='#f1079' class='c007'><sup>[1079]</sup></a> From which it is clearly shown
that all these virtues are perpetually in God, and that they
can never approach to or depart from Him, whereas by men
they are acquired only slowly, and one by one. And hence
also by these means they seem to have a kind of relationship
with God; and since God knows all things, and none of things
intellectual in themselves can elude His notice<a id='r1080'></a><a href='#f1080' class='c007'><sup>[1080]</sup></a> (for God the
Father alone, and His only-begotten Son, and the Holy Spirit,
not only possess a knowledge of those things which they have
created, but also of themselves), a rational understanding
also, advancing from small things to great, and from things
visible to things invisible, may attain to a more perfect
knowledge. For it is placed in the body, and advances from
sensible things themselves, which are corporeal, to things
that are intellectual. But lest our statement that things
intellectual are not cognisable by the senses should appear
unbecoming, we shall employ the instance of Solomon, who
says, “You will find also a divine sense;”<a id='r1081'></a><a href='#f1081' class='c007'><sup>[1081]</sup></a> by which he
shows that those things which are intellectual are to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>sought out not by means of a bodily sense, but by a certain
other which he calls “divine.” And with this sense must
we look on each of those rational beings which we have
enumerated above; and with this sense are to be understood
those words which we speak, and those statements to be
weighed which we commit to writing. For the divine nature
knows even those thoughts which we revolve within us in
silence. And on those matters of which we have spoken, or
on the others which follow from them, according to the rule
above laid down, are our opinions to be formed.</p>

  <h3 id='letter-susanna' class='c001'>A LETTER TO ORIGEN FROM AFRICANUS ABOUT THE HISTORY OF SUSANNA.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c005'>Greeting, my lord and son, most worthy Origen,
from Africanus. In your sacred discussion with
Agnomon you referred to that prophecy of Daniel
which is related of his youth. This at that time,
as was meet, I accepted as genuine. Now, however, I cannot
understand how it escaped you that this part of the book is
spurious. For, in sooth, this section, although apart from
this it is elegantly written, is plainly a more modern forgery.
There are many proofs of this. When Susanna is condemned
to die, the prophet is seized by the Spirit, and cries out that
the sentence is unjust. Now, in the first place, it is always in
some other way that Daniel prophesies—by visions, and dreams,
and an angel appearing to him, never by prophetic inspiration.
Then, after crying out in this extraordinary fashion,
he detects them in a way no less incredible, which not even
Philistion the play-writer would have resorted to. For, not
satisfied with rebuking them through the Spirit, he placed
them apart, and asked them severally where they saw her
committing adultery. And when the one said, “Under a
holm-tree” (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><i>prinos</i></span>), he answered that the angel would saw
him asunder (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><i>prisein</i></span>); and in a similar fashion menaced the
other who said, “Under a mastich-tree” (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><i>schinos</i></span>), with being
rent asunder (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><i>schisthenai</i></span>). Now, in Greek, it happens that
“holm-tree” and “saw asunder,” and “rend” and “mastich-tree”
sound alike; but in Hebrew they are quite distinct.
But all the books of the Old Testament have been translated
from Hebrew into Greek.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>2. Moreover, how is it that they who were captives among
the Chaldæans, lost and won at play,<a id='r1082'></a><a href='#f1082' class='c007'><sup>[1082]</sup></a> thrown out unburied on
the streets, as was prophesied of the former captivity, their
sons torn from them to be eunuchs, and their daughters to be
concubines, as had been prophesied; how is it that such could
pass sentence of death, and that on the wife of their king
Joakim, whom the king of the Babylonians had made partner
of his throne? Then if it was not this Joakim, but some
other from the common people, whence had a captive such a
mansion and spacious garden? But a more fatal objection
is, that this section, along with the other two at the end of it,
is not contained in the Daniel received among the Jews. And
add that, among all the many prophets who had been before,
there is no one who has quoted from another word for word.
For they had no need to go a-begging for words, since their
own were true; but this one, in rebuking one of those men,
quotes the words of the Lord: “The innocent and righteous
shalt thou not slay.” From all this I infer that this section
is a later addition. Moreover, the style is different. I have
struck the blow; do you give the echo; answer, and instruct
me. Salute all my masters. The learned all salute thee.
With all my heart I pray for your and your circle’s health.</p>

  <h3 id='letter-africanus' class='c001'>A LETTER FROM ORIGEN TO AFRICANUS.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c005'>Origen to Africanus, a beloved brother in God
the Father, through Jesus Christ, His holy child,
greeting. Your letter, from which I learn what
you think of the Susanna in the book of Daniel,
which is used in the churches, although apparently somewhat
short, presents in its few words many problems, each of which
demands no common treatment, but such as oversteps the
character of a letter, and reaches the limits of a discourse.
And I, when I consider, as best I can, the measure of my
intellect, that I may know myself, am aware that I am
wanting in the accuracy necessary to reply to your letter;
and that the more, that the few days I have spent in Nicomedia
have been far from sufficient to send you an answer
to all your demands and queries even after the fashion of the
present epistle. Wherefore pardon my little ability, and the
little time I had, and read this letter with all indulgence,
supplying anything I may omit.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. You begin by saying, that when, in my discussion
with our friend Bassus, I used the Scripture which contains
the prophecy of Daniel when yet a young man in the
affair of Susanna, I did this as if it had escaped me that
this part of the book was spurious. You say that you praise
this passage as elegantly written, but find fault with it as a
more modern composition, and a forgery; and you add that
the forger has had recourse to something which not even
Philistion the play-writer would have used in his puns between
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><i>prinos</i></span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><i>prisein</i></span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><i>schinos</i></span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><i>schisis</i></span>, which words as
they sound in Greek can be used in this way, but not in
Hebrew. In answer to this, I have to tell you what it behoves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>us to do in the cases not only of the History of Susanna,
which is found in every church of Christ in that Greek
copy which the Greeks use, but is not in the Hebrew, or of
the two other passages you mention at the end of the book
containing the history of Bel and the Dragon, which likewise
are not in the Hebrew copy of Daniel; but of thousands of
other passages also which I found in many places when with
my little strength I was collating the Hebrew copies with
ours. For in Daniel itself I found the word “bound” followed
in our versions by very many verses which are not in
the Hebrew at all, beginning (according to one of the copies
which circulate in the churches) thus: “Ananias, and
Azarias, and Misael prayed and sang unto God,” down to
“O, all ye that worship the Lord, bless ye the God of gods.
Praise Him, and say that His mercy endureth for ever and
ever. And it came to pass, when the king heard them singing,
and saw them that they were alive.” Or, as in another
copy, from “And they walked in the midst of the fire, praising
God and blessing the Lord,” down to “O, all ye that worship
the Lord, bless ye the God of gods. Praise Him, and say
that His mercy endureth to all generations.”<a id='r1083'></a><a href='#f1083' class='c007'><sup>[1083]</sup></a> But in the
Hebrew copies the words, “And these three men, Sedrach,
Misach, and Abdenego fell down bound into the midst of the
fire,” are immediately followed by the verse, “Nabouchodonosor
the king was astonished, and rose up in haste, and spake,
and said unto his counsellors.” For so Aquila, following the
Hebrew reading, gives it, who has obtained the credit among
the Jews of having interpreted the Scriptures with no ordinary
care, and whose version is most commonly used by those
who do not know Hebrew, as the one which has been most
successful. Of the copies in my possession whose readings
I gave, one follows the Seventy, and the other Theodotion;
and just as the History of Susanna which you call a forgery
is found in both, together with the passages at the end of
Daniel, so they give also these passages, amounting, to make
a rough guess, to more than two hundred verses.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. And in many other of the sacred books I found sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>more in our copies than in the Hebrew, sometimes less.
I shall adduce a few examples, since it is impossible to give
them all. Of the book of Esther neither the prayer of Mardochaios
nor that of Esther, both fitted to edify the reader, is
found in the Hebrew. Neither are the letters;<a id='r1084'></a><a href='#f1084' class='c007'><sup>[1084]</sup></a> nor the one
written to Amman about the rooting up of the Jewish nation,
nor that of Mardochaios in the name of Artaxerxes delivering
the nation from death. Then in Job, the words from “It
is written, that he shall rise again with those whom the Lord
raises,” to the end, are not in the Hebrew, and so not in
Aquila’s edition; while they are found in the Septuagint and
in Theodotion’s version, agreeing with each other at least in
sense. And many other places I found in Job where our
copies have more than the Hebrew ones, sometimes a little
more, and sometimes a great deal more: a little more, as when
to the words, “Rising up in the morning, he offered burnt-offerings
for them according to their number,” they add, “one
heifer for the sin of their soul;” and to the words, “The
angels of God came to present themselves before God, and the
devil came with them,” “from going to and fro in the earth,
and from walking up and down in it.” Again, after “The
Lord gave, the Lord has taken away,” the Hebrew has not,
“It was so, as seemed good to the Lord.” Then our copies
are very much fuller than the Hebrew, when Job’s wife
speaks to him, from “How long wilt thou hold out? And
he said, Lo, I wait yet a little while, looking for the hope of
my salvation,” down to “that I may cease from my troubles,
and my sorrows which compass me.” For they have only
these words of the woman, “But say a word against God,
and die.”</p>

<p class='c006'>4. Again, through the whole of Job there are many passages
in the Hebrew which are wanting in our copies, generally
four or five verses, but sometimes, however, even fourteen,
and nineteen, and sixteen. But why should I enumerate all
the instances I collected with so much labour, to prove that
the difference between our copies and those of the Jews did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>not escape me? In Jeremiah I noticed many instances, and
indeed in that book I found much transposition and variation
in the readings of the prophecies. Again, in Genesis, the
words, “God saw that it was good,” when the firmament was
made, are not found in the Hebrew, and there is no small
dispute among them about this; and other instances are to be
found in Genesis, which I marked, for the sake of distinction,
with the sign the Greeks call an obelisk, as on the other
hand I marked with an asterisk those passages in our copies
which are not found in the Hebrew. What needs there
speak of Exodus, where there is such diversity in what is said
about the tabernacle and its court, and the ark, and the garments
of the high priest and the priests, that sometimes the
meaning even does not seem to be akin? And, forsooth, when
we notice such things, we are forthwith to reject as spurious
the copies in use in our churches, and enjoin the brotherhood
to put away the sacred books current among them, and to
coax the Jews, and persuade them to give us copies which
shall be untampered with, and free from forgery! Are we to
suppose that that Providence which in the sacred Scriptures
has ministered to the edification of all the churches of Christ,
had no thought for those bought with a price,<a id='r1085'></a><a href='#f1085' class='c007'><sup>[1085]</sup></a> for whom
Christ died; whom, although his Son, God who is love spared
not, but gave Him up for us all, that with Him He might
freely give us all things?<a id='r1086'></a><a href='#f1086' class='c007'><sup>[1086]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>5. In all these cases consider whether it would not be well
to remember the words, “Thou shalt not remove the ancient
landmarks which thy fathers have set.”<a id='r1087'></a><a href='#f1087' class='c007'><sup>[1087]</sup></a> Nor do I say this
because I shun the labour of investigating the Jewish Scriptures,
and comparing them with ours, and noticing their various
readings. This, if it be not arrogant to say it, I have already
to a great extent done to the best of my ability, labouring
hard to get at the meaning in all the editions and various
readings;<a id='r1088'></a><a href='#f1088' class='c007'><sup>[1088]</sup></a> while I paid particular attention to the interpretation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>of the Seventy, lest I might be found to accredit any
forgery to the churches which are under heaven, and give an
occasion to those who seek such a starting-point for gratifying
their desire to slander the common brethren, and to bring some
accusation against those who shine forth in our community.
And I make it my endeavour not to be ignorant of their
various readings, lest in my controversies with the Jews I
should quote to them what is not found in their copies, and
that I may make some use of what is found there, even
although it should not be in our Scriptures. For if we are
so prepared for them in our discussions, they will not, as is
their manner, scornfully laugh at Gentile believers for their
ignorance of the true reading as they have them. So far as
to the History of Susanna not being found in the Hebrew.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. Let us now look at the things you find fault with in the
story itself. And here let us begin with what would probably
make any one averse to receiving the history: I mean
the play of words between <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><i>prinos</i></span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><i>prisis</i></span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><i>schinos</i></span> and
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><i>schisis</i></span>. You say that you can see how this can be in Greek,
but that in Hebrew the words are altogether distinct. On
this point, however, I am still in doubt; because, when I was
considering this passage (for I myself saw this difficulty), I
consulted not a few Jews about it, asking them the Hebrew
words for <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><i>prinos</i></span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><i>prisein</i></span>, and how they would translate
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><i>schinos</i></span> the tree, and how <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><i>schisis</i></span>. And they said that they
did not know these Greek words <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><i>prinos</i></span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><i>schinos</i></span>, and
asked me to show them the trees, that they might see what
they called them. And I at once (for the truth’s dear sake)
put before them pieces of the different trees. One of them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>then said, that he could not with any certainty give the
Hebrew name of anything not mentioned in Scripture, since,
if one was at a loss, he was prone to use the Syriac word
instead of the Hebrew one; and he went on to say, that
some words the very wisest could not translate. “If, then,”
said he, “you can adduce a passage in any Scripture where
the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><i>schinos</i></span> is mentioned, or the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><i>prinos</i></span>, you will find there the
words you seek, together with the words which have the
same sound; but if it is nowhere mentioned, we also do not
know it.” This, then, being what the Hebrews said to whom I
had recourse, and who were acquainted with the history, I am
cautious of affirming whether or not there is any correspondence
to this play of words in the Hebrew. Your reason for
affirming that there is not, you yourself probably know.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. Moreover, I remember hearing from a learned Hebrew,
said among themselves to be the son of a wise man, and to
have been specially trained to succeed his father, with whom
I had intercourse on many subjects, the names of these
elders, just as if he did not reject the History of Susanna,
as they occur in Jeremia as follows: “The Lord make thee
like Zedekias and Achiab, whom the king of Babylon roasted
in the fire, for the iniquity they did in Israel.”<a id='r1089'></a><a href='#f1089' class='c007'><sup>[1089]</sup></a> How, then,
could the one be sawn asunder by an angel, and the other
rent in pieces? The answer is, that these things were prophesied
not of this world, but of the judgment of God, after
the departure from this world. For as the lord of that
wicked servant who says, “My lord delayeth his coming,”
and so gives himself up to drunkenness, eating and drinking
with drunkards, and smiting his fellow-servants, shall at his
coming “cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with
the unbelievers,”<a id='r1090'></a><a href='#f1090' class='c007'><sup>[1090]</sup></a> even so the angels appointed to punish will
accomplish these things (just as they will cut asunder the
wicked steward of that passage) on these men, who were
called indeed elders, but who administered their stewardship
wickedly. One will saw asunder him who was waxen old in
wicked days, who had pronounced false judgment, condemning
the innocent, and letting the guilty go free;<a id='r1091'></a><a href='#f1091' class='c007'><sup>[1091]</sup></a> and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>another will rend in pieces him of the seed of Chanaan, and
not of Judah, whom beauty had deceived, and whose heart
lust had perverted.<a id='r1092'></a><a href='#f1092' class='c007'><sup>[1092]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>8. And I knew another Hebrew, who told about these
elders such traditions as the following: that they pretended
to the Jews in captivity, who were hoping by the coming of
Christ to be freed from the yoke of their enemies, that they
could explain clearly the things concerning Christ, ... and
that they so deceived the wives of their countrymen.<a id='r1093'></a><a href='#f1093' class='c007'><sup>[1093]</sup></a> Wherefore
it is that the prophet Daniel calls the one “waxen old in
wicked days,” and says to the other, “Thus have ye dealt
with the children of Israel; but the daughters of Juda would
not abide your wickedness.”</p>

<p class='c006'>9. But probably to this you will say, Why then is the “History”
not in their Daniel, if, as you say, their wise men hand
down by tradition such stories? The answer is, that they hid
from the knowledge of the people as many of the passages
which contained any scandal against the elders, rulers, and
judges, as they could, some of which have been preserved in
uncanonical writings (Apocrypha). As an example, take the
story told about Esaias, and guaranteed by the Epistle to the
Hebrews, which is found in none of their public books. For
the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, in speaking of the
prophets, and what they suffered, says, “They were stoned,
they were sawn asunder, they were slain with the sword.”<a id='r1094'></a><a href='#f1094' class='c007'><sup>[1094]</sup></a>
To whom, I ask, does the “sawn asunder” refer (for by an
old idiom, not peculiar to Hebrew, but found also in Greek,
this is said in the plural, although it refers to but one person)?
Now we know very well that tradition says that
Esaias the prophet was sawn asunder; and this is found in
some apocryphal work, which probably the Jews have purposely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>tampered with, introducing some phrases manifestly
incorrect, that discredit might be thrown on the whole.</p>

<p class='c006'>However, some one hard pressed by this argument may
have recourse to the opinion of those who reject this epistle
as not being Paul’s; against whom I must at some other
time use other arguments to prove that it is Paul’s. At present
I shall adduce from the Gospel what Jesus Christ testifies
concerning the prophets, together with a story which He refers
to, but which is not found in the Old Testament, since in it
also there is a scandal against unjust judges in Israel. The
words of our Saviour run thus: “Woe unto you, scribes
and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the
prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous, and
say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not
have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.
Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the
children of them which killed the prophets. Fill ye up then
the measure of your fathers. Ye serpents, ye generation of
vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of Gehenna? Wherefore,
behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and
scribes; and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and
some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute
them from city to city: that upon you may come all
the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of
righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias, son of Barachias,
whom ye slew between the temple and the altar. Verily I
say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation.”
And what follows is of the same tenor: “O Jerusalem,
Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest
them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have
gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her
chickens under her wings, and ye would not! Behold, your
house is left unto you desolate.”<a id='r1095'></a><a href='#f1095' class='c007'><sup>[1095]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Let us see now if in these cases we are not forced to the
conclusion, that while the Saviour gives a true account of
them, none of the Scriptures which could prove what He
tells are to be found. For they who build the tombs of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>prophets and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous, condemning
the crimes their fathers committed against the
righteous and the prophets, say, “If we had been in the
days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with
them in the blood of the prophets.”<a id='r1096'></a><a href='#f1096' class='c007'><sup>[1096]</sup></a> In the blood of what
prophets, can any one tell me? For where do we find anything
like this written of Esaias, or Jeremias, or any of the
twelve, or Daniel? Then about Zacharias the son of Barachias,
who was slain between the temple and the altar, we
learn from Jesus only, not knowing it otherwise from any
Scripture. Wherefore I think no other supposition is possible,
than that they who had the reputation of wisdom, and
the rulers and elders, took away from the people every passage
which might bring them into discredit among the people.
We need not wonder, then, if this history of the evil device
of the licentious elders against Susanna is true, but was concealed
and removed from the Scriptures by men themselves
not very far removed from the counsel of these elders.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the Acts of the Apostles also, Stephen, in his other testimony,
says, “Which of the prophets have not your fathers
persecuted? And they have slain them which showed before
of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now
the betrayers and murderers.”<a id='r1097'></a><a href='#f1097' class='c007'><sup>[1097]</sup></a> That Stephen speaks the
truth, every one will admit who receives the Acts of the
Apostles; but it is impossible to show from the extant books
of the Old Testament how with any justice he throws the
blame of having persecuted and slain the prophets on the
fathers of those who believed not in Christ. And Paul, in the
first Epistle to the Thessalonians, testifies this concerning the
Jews: “For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches
of God which in Judea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have
suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they
have of the Jews; who both killed the Lord Jesus and their
own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not
God, and are contrary to all men.”<a id='r1098'></a><a href='#f1098' class='c007'><sup>[1098]</sup></a> What I have said is, I
think, sufficient to prove that it would be nothing wonderful if
this history were true, and the licentious and cruel attack was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>actually made on Susanna by those who were at that time
elders, and written down by the wisdom of the Spirit, but
removed by these rulers of Sodom,<a id='r1099'></a><a href='#f1099' class='c007'><sup>[1099]</sup></a> as the Spirit would call
them.</p>

<p class='c006'>10. Your next objection is, that in this writing Daniel
is said to have been seized by the Spirit, and to have cried
out that the sentence was unjust; while in that writing of
his which is universally received he is represented as prophesying
in quite another manner, by visions and dreams,
and an angel appearing to him, but never by prophetic inspiration.
You seem to me to pay too little heed to the words,
“At sundry times, and in divers manners, God spake in time
past unto the fathers by the prophets.”<a id='r1100'></a><a href='#f1100' class='c007'><sup>[1100]</sup></a> This is true not
only in the general, but also of individuals. For if you
notice, you will find that the same saints have been favoured
with divine dreams and angelic appearances and [direct] inspirations.
For the present it will suffice to instance what is
testified concerning Jacob. Of dreams from God he speaks
thus: “And it came to pass, at the time that the cattle conceived,
that I saw them before my eyes in a dream, and,
behold, the rams and he-goats which leaped upon the sheep
and the goats, white-spotted, and speckled, and grisled. And
the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob.
And I said, What is it? And he said, Lift up thine eyes
and see, the goats and rams leaping on the goats and sheep,
white-spotted, and speckled, and grisled: for I have seen all
that Laban doeth unto thee. I am God, who appeared unto
thee in the place of God, where thou anointedst to me there
a pillar, and vowed a vow there to me: now arise, get thee
out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.”<a id='r1101'></a><a href='#f1101' class='c007'><sup>[1101]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>And as to an appearance (which is better than a dream),
he speaks as follows about himself: “And Jacob was left
alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking
of the day. And he saw that he prevailed not against him,
and he touched the breadth of his thigh; and the breadth of
Jacob’s thigh grew stiff while he was wrestling with him.
And he said to him, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me. And
he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.
And he said to him, Thy name shall be called no more
Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: for thou hast prevailed
with God, and art powerful with men. And Jacob asked
him, and said, Tell me thy name. And he said, Wherefore
is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him
there. And Jacob called the name of the place Vision of
God: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.
And the sun rose, when the vision of God passed
by.”<a id='r1102'></a><a href='#f1102' class='c007'><sup>[1102]</sup></a> And that he also prophesied by inspiration, is evident
from this passage: “And Jacob called unto his sons, and
said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you what
shall befall you in the last days. Gather yourselves together,
and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your
father. Reuben, my first-born, my might, and the beginning
of my children, hard to be born, hard and stubborn. Thou
wert wanton, boil not over like water; because thou wentest
up to thy father’s bed; then defiledst thou the couch to which
thou wentest up.”<a id='r1103'></a><a href='#f1103' class='c007'><sup>[1103]</sup></a> And so with the rest: it was by inspiration
that the prophetic blessings were pronounced. We
need not wonder, then, that Daniel sometimes prophesied by
inspiration, as when he rebuked the elders sometimes, as you
say, by dreams and visions, and at other times by an angel
appearing unto him.</p>

<p class='c006'>11. Your other objections are stated, as it appears to me,
somewhat irreverently, and without the becoming spirit of
piety. I cannot do better than quote your very words: “Then,
after crying out in this extraordinary fashion, he detects
them in a way no less incredible, which not even Philistion
the play-writer would have resorted to. For, not satisfied
with rebuking them through the Spirit, he placed them apart,
and asked them severally where they saw her committing adultery;
and when the one said, ‘Under a holm-tree’ (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><i>prinos</i></span>),
he answered that the angel would saw him asunder (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><i>prisein</i></span>);
and in a similar fashion threatened the other, who said,
‘Under a mastich-tree’ (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><i>schinos</i></span>), with being rent asunder.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>You might as reasonably compare to Philistion the play-writer,
a story somewhat like this one, which is found in the
third book of Kings, which you yourself will admit to be
well written. Here is what we read in Kings:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then there appeared two women that were harlots before
the king, and stood before him. And the one woman said,
To me, my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and
we were delivered in the house. And it came to pass, the
third day after that I was delivered, that this woman was
delivered also: and we were together; there is no one in our
house except us two. And this woman’s child died in the
night; because she overlaid it. And she arose at midnight,
and took my son from my arms. And thine handmaid slept.
And she laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my
bosom. And I arose in the morning to give my child suck,
and he was dead; but when I had considered it in the morning,
behold, it was not my son which I did bear. And the
other woman said, Nay; the dead is thy son, but the living is
my son. And the other said, No; the living is my son, but
the dead is thy son. Thus they spake before the king. Then
said the king, Thou sayest, This is my son that liveth, and thy
son is the dead: and thou sayest, Nay; but thy son is the
dead, and my son is the living. And the king said, Bring me a
sword. And they brought a sword before the king. And the
king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the
one, and half to the other. Then spake the woman whose the
living child was unto the king (for her bowels yearned after
her son), and she said, To me, my lord, give her the living
child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, Let it be
neither mine nor thine, but divide it. Then the king answered
and said, Give the child to her which said, Give her the
living child, and in no wise slay it: for she is the mother of
it. And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had
judged; and they feared the face of the king: for they saw
that the wisdom of God was in him to do judgment.”<a id='r1104'></a><a href='#f1104' class='c007'><sup>[1104]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>For if we were at liberty to speak in this scoffing way of
the Scriptures in use in the churches, we should rather compare
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>this story of the two harlots to the play of Philistion than
that of the chaste Susanna. And just as the people would
not have been persuaded if Solomon had merely said, “Give
this one the living child, for she is the mother of it;” so
Daniel’s attack on the elders would not have been sufficient
had there not been added the condemnation from their own
mouth, when both said that they had seen her lying with the
young man under a tree, but did not agree as to what kind
of tree it was. And since you have asserted, as if you knew
for certain, that Daniel in this matter judged by inspiration
(which may or may not have been the case), I would have
you notice that there seem to me to be some analogies in the
story of Daniel to the judgment of Solomon, concerning whom
the Scripture testifies that the people saw that the wisdom of
God was in him to do judgment.<a id='r1105'></a><a href='#f1105' class='c007'><sup>[1105]</sup></a> This might be said also of
Daniel, for it was because wisdom was in him to do judgment
that the elders were judged in the manner described.</p>

<p class='c006'>12. I had nearly forgotten an additional remark I have
to make about the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><i>prino-prisein</i></span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><i>schino-schisein</i></span> difficulty;
that is, that in our Scriptures there are many etymological
fancies, so to call them, which in the Hebrew are perfectly
suitable, but not in the Greek. It need not surprise us, then,
if the translators of the History of Susanna contrived it so
that they found out some Greek words, derived from the
same root, which either corresponded exactly to the Hebrew
form (though this I hardly think possible), or presented some
analogy to it. Here is an instance of this in our Scripture.
When the woman was made by God from the rib of the
man, Adam says, “She shall be called woman, because she
was taken out of her husband.” Now the Jews say that the
woman was called “<i>Essa</i>,” and that “taken” is a translation
of this word, as is evident from “<i>chos isouoth essa</i>,” which
means, “I have taken the cup of salvation;”<a id='r1106'></a><a href='#f1106' class='c007'><sup>[1106]</sup></a> and that “<i>is</i>”
means “man,” as we see from “<i>Hesre aïs</i>,” which is, “Blessed
is the man.”<a id='r1107'></a><a href='#f1107' class='c007'><sup>[1107]</sup></a> According to the Jews, then, “<i>is</i>” is “man,”
and “<i>essa</i>” “woman,” because she was taken out of her husband
(<i>is</i>). It need not then surprise us if some interpreters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>of the Hebrew “Susanna,” which had been concealed among
them at a very remote date, and had been preserved only by
the more learned and honest, should have either given the
Hebrew word for word, or hit upon some analogy to the
Hebrew forms, that the Greeks might be able to follow them.
For in many other passages we can find traces of this kind
of contrivance on the part of the translators, which I noticed
when I was collating the various editions.</p>

<p class='c006'>13. You raise another objection, which I give in your own
words: “Moreover, how is it that they, who were captives
among the Chaldæans, lost and won at play, thrown out
unburied on the streets, as was prophesied of the former captivity,
their sons torn from them to be eunuchs, and their
daughters to be concubines, as had been prophesied; how is
it that such could pass sentence of death, and that on the
wife of their king Joakim, whom the king of the Babylonians
had made partner of his throne? Then, if it was
not this Joakim, but some other from the common people,
whence had a captive such a mansion and spacious garden?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Where you get your “lost and won at play, and thrown out
unburied on the streets,” I know not, unless it is from Tobias;
and Tobias (as also Judith), we ought to notice, the Jews do
not use. They are not even found in the Hebrew Apocrypha,
as I learned from the Jews themselves. However, since the
churches use Tobias, you must know that even in the captivity
some of the captives were rich and well to do. Tobias himself
says, “Because I remembered God with all my heart;
and the Most High gave me grace and beauty in the eyes of
Nemessarus, and I was his purveyor; and I went into Media,
and left in trust with Gabael, the brother of Gabrias at Ragi,
a city of Media, ten talents of silver.”<a id='r1108'></a><a href='#f1108' class='c007'><sup>[1108]</sup></a> And he adds, as he
were a rich man, “In the days of Nemessarus I gave many
alms to my brethren. I gave my bread to the hungry, and
my clothes to the naked: and if I saw any of my nation dead,
and cast outside the walls of Nineve, I buried him; and if
king Senachereim had slain any when he came fleeing from
Judea, I buried them privily (for in his wrath he killed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>many).” Think whether this great catalogue of Tobias’ good
deeds does not betoken great wealth and much property,
especially when he adds, “Understanding that I was sought
for to be put to death, I withdrew myself for fear, and all my
goods were forcibly taken away.”<a id='r1109'></a><a href='#f1109' class='c007'><sup>[1109]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>And another captive, Dachiacharus, the son of Ananiel,
the brother of Tobias, was set over all the exchequer of the
kingdom of king Acherdon; and we read, “Now Achiacharus
was cup-bearer and keeper of the signet, and steward and
overseer of the accounts.”<a id='r1110'></a><a href='#f1110' class='c007'><sup>[1110]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Mardochaios, too, frequented the court of the king, and
had such boldness before him, that he was inscribed among
the benefactors of Artaxerxes.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again we read in Esdras, that Neemias, a cup-bearer and
eunuch of the king, of Hebrew race, made a request about
the rebuilding of the temple, and obtained it; so that it was
granted to him, with many more, to return and build the
temple again. Why then should we wonder that one Joakim
had garden, and house, and property, whether these were
very expensive or only moderate, for this is not clearly told
us in the writing?</p>

<p class='c006'>14. But you say, “How could they who were in captivity
pass sentence of death?” asserting, I know not on what
grounds, that Susanna was the wife of a king, because of the
name Joakim. The answer is, that it is no uncommon thing,
when great nations become subject, that the king should
allow the captives to use their own laws and courts of justice.
Now, for instance, that the Romans rule, and the Jews pay
the half-shekel to them, how great power by the concession
of Cæsar the ethnarch has; so that we, who have had experience
of it, know that he differs in little from a true king!
Private trials are held according to the law, and some are
condemned to death. And though there is not full licence
for this, still it is not done without the knowledge of the
ruler, as we learned and were convinced of when we spent
much time in the country of that people. And yet the
Romans only take account of two tribes, while at that time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>besides Juda there were the ten tribes of Israel. Probably
the Assyrians contented themselves with holding them in subjection,
and conceded to them their own judicial processes.</p>

<p class='c006'>15. I find in your letter yet another objection in these
words: “And add, that among all the many prophets who had
been before, there is no one who has quoted from another
word for word. For they had no need to go a-begging for
words, since their own were true. But this one, in rebuking
one of these men, quotes the words of the Lord, ‘The innocent
and righteous shalt thou not slay.’” I cannot understand
how, with all your exercise in investigating and meditating on
the Scriptures, you have not noticed that the prophets continually
quote each other almost word for word. For who of
all believers does not know the words in Esaias? “And in
the last days the mountain of the Lord shall be manifest, and
the house of the Lord on the top of the mountains, and it
shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall come
unto it. And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and
let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, unto the house of
the God of Jacob; and He will teach us His way, and we
will walk in it: for out of Zion shall go forth a law, and a
word of the Lord from Jerusalem. And He shall judge
among the nations, and shall rebuke many people; and they
shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into
pruning-hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation,
neither shall they learn war any more.”<a id='r1111'></a><a href='#f1111' class='c007'><sup>[1111]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>But in Micah we find a parallel passage, which is almost
word for word: “And in the last days the mountain of the
Lord shall be manifest, established on the top of the mountains,
and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall
hasten unto it. And many nations shall come, and say,
Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house
of the God of Jacob; and they will teach us His way, and
we will walk in His paths: for a law shall go forth from Zion,
and a word of the Lord from Jerusalem. And He shall
judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations; and
they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>into pruning-hooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against
nation, neither shall they learn war any more.”<a id='r1112'></a><a href='#f1112' class='c007'><sup>[1112]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Again, in First Chronicles, the psalm which is put in the
hands of Asaph and his brethren to praise the Lord, beginning,
“Give thanks unto the Lord, call upon His name,”<a id='r1113'></a><a href='#f1113' class='c007'><sup>[1113]</sup></a> is
in the beginning almost identical with <abbr title='Psalms'>Ps.</abbr> <abbr title='a hundred and four'>civ.</abbr>, down to “and
do my prophets no harm;” and after that it is the same as
<abbr title='Psalms'>Ps.</abbr> <abbr title='ninety-five'>xcv.</abbr>, from the beginning of that psalm, which is something
like this, “Praise the Lord all the earth,” down to “For He
cometh to judge the earth.” (It would have taken up too
much time to quote more fully; so I have given these short
references, which are sufficient for the matter before us.)
And you will find the law about not bearing a burden on the
Sabbath-day in Jeremia, as well as in Moses.<a id='r1114'></a><a href='#f1114' class='c007'><sup>[1114]</sup></a> And the
rules about the passover, and the rules for the priests, are
not only in Moses, but also at the end of Ezekiel.<a id='r1115'></a><a href='#f1115' class='c007'><sup>[1115]</sup></a> I would
have quoted these, and many more, had I not found that
from the shortness of my stay in Nicomedia my time for
writing you was already too much restricted.</p>

<p class='c006'>Your last objection is, that the style is different. This I
cannot see.</p>

<p class='c006'>This, then, is my defence. I might, especially after all
these accusations, speak in praise of this history of Susanna,
dwelling on it word by word, and expounding the exquisite
nature of the thoughts. Such an encomium, perhaps, some of
the learned and able students of divine things may at some
other time compose. This, however, is my answer to your
strokes, as you call them. Would that I could instruct you!
But I do not now arrogate that to myself. My lord and dear
brother Ambrosius, who has written this at my dictation, and
has, in looking over it, corrected as he pleased, salutes you.
His faithful spouse, Marcella, and her children, also salute
you. Also Anicetus. Do you salute our dear father Apollinarius,
and all our friends.</p>

  <h3 id='letter-gregory' class='c001'>A LETTER FROM ORIGEN TO GREGORY.<a id='r1116'></a><a href='#f1116' class='c007'><sup>[1116]</sup></a></h3>
</div>
<p class='c005'>Greeting in God, my most excellent sir, and
venerable son Gregory, from Origen. A natural
readiness of comprehension, as you well know,
may, if practice be added, contribute somewhat to
the contingent end, if I may so call it, of that which any one
wishes to practise. Thus, your natural good parts might
make of you a finished Roman lawyer or a Greek philosopher,
so to speak, of one of the schools in high reputation.
But I am anxious that you should devote all the strength of
your natural good parts to Christianity for your end; and in
order to this, I wish to ask you to extract from the philosophy
of the Greeks what may serve as a course of study or
a preparation for Christianity, and from geometry and astronomy
what will serve to explain the sacred Scriptures, in
order that all that the sons of the philosophers are wont to
say about geometry and music, grammar, rhetoric, and astronomy,
as fellow-helpers to philosophy, we may say about
philosophy itself, in relation to Christianity.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Perhaps something of this kind is shadowed forth in what
is written in Exodus from the mouth of God, that the children
of Israel were commanded to ask from their neighbours,
and those who dwelt with them, vessels of silver and gold,
and raiment, in order that, by spoiling the Egyptians, they
might have material for the preparation of the things which
pertained to the service of God. For from the things which
the children of Israel took from the Egyptians the vessels in
the holy of holies were made,—the ark with its lid, and the
cherubim, and the mercy-seat, and the golden coffer, where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>was the manna, the angels’ bread. These things were probably
made from the best of the Egyptian gold. An inferior
kind would be used for the solid golden candlestick near the
inner veil, and its branches, and the golden table on which
were the pieces of shewbread, and the golden censer between
them. And if there was a third and fourth quality of gold,
from it would be made the holy vessels; and the other things
would be made of Egyptian silver. For when the children
of Israel dwelt in Egypt, they gained this from their dwelling
there, that they had no lack of such precious material for the
utensils of the service of God. And of the Egyptian raiment
were probably made all those things which, as the Scripture
mentions, needed sewed and embroidered work, sewed with
the wisdom of God, the one to the other, that the veils might
be made, and the inner and the outer courts. And why
should I go on, in this untimely digression, to set forth how
useful to the children of Israel were the things brought from
Egypt, which the Egyptians had not put to a proper use, but
which the Hebrews, guided by the wisdom of God, used for
God’s service? Now the sacred Scripture is wont to represent
as an evil the going down from the land of the children of
Israel into Egypt, indicating that certain persons get harm
from sojourning among the Egyptians, that is to say, from
meddling with the knowledge of this world, after they have
subscribed to the law of God, and the Israelitish service of
Him. Ader<a id='r1117'></a><a href='#f1117' class='c007'><sup>[1117]</sup></a> at least, the Idumæan, so long as he was in the
land of Israel, and had not tasted the bread of the Egyptians,
made no idols. It was when he fled from the wise Solomon,
and went down into Egypt, as it were flying from the wisdom
of God, and was made a kinsman of Pharaoh by marrying
his wife’s sister, and begetting a child, who was brought
up with the children of Pharaoh, that he did this. Wherefore,
although he did return to the land of Israel, he returned only
to divide the people of God, and to make them say to the
golden calf, “These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought
thee up from the land of Egypt.” And I may tell you from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>my experience, that not many take from Egypt only the
useful, and go away and use it for the service of God; while
Ader the Idumæan has many brethren. These are they
who, from their Greek studies, produce heretical notions, and
set them up, like the golden calf, in Bethel, which signifies
“God’s house.” In these words also there seems to me an
indication that they have set up their own imaginations in
the Scriptures, where the word of God dwells, which is called
in a figure Bethel. The other figure, the word says, was set
up in <abbr title='Daniel'>Dan.</abbr> Now the borders of Dan are the most extreme,
and nearest the borders of the Gentiles, as is clear from what
is written in Joshua, the son of Nun. Now some of the
devices of these brethren of Ader, as we call them, are also
very near the borders of the Gentiles.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. Do you then, my son, diligently apply yourself to the
reading of the sacred Scriptures. Apply yourself, I say. For
we who read the things of God need much application, lest
we should say or think anything too rashly about them. And
applying yourself thus to the study of the things of God,
with faithful prejudgments such as are well pleasing to God,
knock at its locked door, and it will be opened to you by the
porter, of whom Jesus says, “To him the porter opens.”<a id='r1118'></a><a href='#f1118' class='c007'><sup>[1118]</sup></a>
And applying yourself thus to the divine study, seek aright,
and with unwavering trust in God, the meaning of the holy
Scriptures, which so many have missed. Be not satisfied with
knocking and seeking; for prayer is of all things indispensable
to the knowledge of the things of God. For to this the
Saviour exhorted, and said not only, “Knock, and it shall be
opened to you; and seek, and ye shall find,”<a id='r1119'></a><a href='#f1119' class='c007'><sup>[1119]</sup></a> but also, “Ask,
and it shall be given unto you.”<a id='r1120'></a><a href='#f1120' class='c007'><sup>[1120]</sup></a> My fatherly love to you
has made me thus bold; but whether my boldness be good,
God will know, and His Christ, and all partakers of the Spirit
of God and the Spirit of Christ. May you also be a partaker,
and be ever increasing your inheritance, that you may say
not only, “We are become partakers of Christ,”<a id='r1121'></a><a href='#f1121' class='c007'><sup>[1121]</sup></a> but also
partakers of God.</p>

</div>
<h4 class='c009'>PREFACE.</h4>
<p class='c005'>1. When false witnesses testified against our Lord
and Saviour Jesus Christ, He remained silent;
and when unfounded charges were brought
against Him, He returned no answer, believing
that His whole life and conduct among the Jews were a better
refutation than any answer to the false testimony, or than
any formal defence against the accusations. And I know
not, my pious Ambrosius,<a id='r1122'></a><a href='#f1122' class='c007'><sup>[1122]</sup></a> why you wished me to write a
reply to the false charges brought by Celsus against the
Christians, and to his accusations directed against the faith
of the churches in his treatise; as if the facts themselves did
not furnish a manifest refutation, and the doctrine a better
answer than any writing, seeing it both disposes of the false
statements, and does not leave to the accusations any credibility
or validity. Now, with respect to our Lord’s silence
when false witness was borne against Him, it is sufficient at
present to quote the words of Matthew, for the testimony of
Mark is to the same effect. And the words of Matthew are
as follow: “And the high priest and the council sought
false witness against Jesus to put Him to death, but found
none, although many false witnesses came forward. At last
two false witnesses came and said, This fellow said, I am
able to destroy the temple of God, and after three days to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>build it up. And the high priest arose, and said to Him,
Answerest thou nothing to what these witness against thee?
But Jesus held His peace.”<a id='r1123'></a><a href='#f1123' class='c007'><sup>[1123]</sup></a> And that He returned no
answer when falsely accused, the following is the statement:
“And Jesus stood before the governor; and he asked Him,
saying, Art thou the king of the Jews? And Jesus said to
him, Thou sayest. And when He was accused of the chief
priests and elders, He answered nothing. Then said Pilate
unto Him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness
against thee? And He answered him to never a word, insomuch
that the governor marvelled greatly.”<a id='r1124'></a><a href='#f1124' class='c007'><sup>[1124]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>2. It was, indeed, matter of surprise to men even of ordinary
intelligence, that one who was accused and assailed by
false testimony, but who was able to defend Himself, and to
show that He was guilty of none of the charges [alleged], and
who might have enumerated the praiseworthy deeds of His
own life, and His miracles wrought by divine power, so as to
give the judge an opportunity of delivering a more honourable
judgment regarding Him, should not have done this, but
should have disdained such a procedure, and in the nobleness
of His nature have contemned His accusers.<a id='r1125'></a><a href='#f1125' class='c007'><sup>[1125]</sup></a> That the judge
would, without any hesitation, have set Him at liberty if He
had offered a defence, is clear from what is related of him
when he said, “Which of the two do ye wish that I should
release unto you, Barabbas or Jesus, who is called Christ?”<a id='r1126'></a><a href='#f1126' class='c007'><sup>[1126]</sup></a>
and from what the Scripture adds, “For he knew that for
envy they had delivered Him.”<a id='r1127'></a><a href='#f1127' class='c007'><sup>[1127]</sup></a> Jesus, however, is at all
times assailed by false witnesses, and, while wickedness remains
in the world, is ever exposed to accusation. And yet
even now He continues silent before these things, and makes
no audible answer, but places His defence in the lives of His
genuine disciples, which are a pre-eminent testimony, and
one that rises superior to all false witness, and refutes and
overthrows all unfounded accusations and charges.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. I venture, then, to say that this “apology” which you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>require me to compose will somewhat weaken that defence
[of Christianity] which rests on facts, and that power of
Jesus which is manifest to those who are not altogether devoid
of perception. Notwithstanding, that we may not have
the appearance of being reluctant to undertake the task
which you have enjoined, we have endeavoured, to the best
of our ability, to suggest, by way of answer to each of the
statements advanced by Celsus, what seemed to us adapted
to refute them, although his arguments have no power to
shake the faith of any [true] believer. And forbid, indeed,
that any one should be found who, after having been a partaker
in such a love of God as was [displayed] in Christ
Jesus, could be shaken in his purpose by the arguments of
Celsus, or of any such as he. For Paul, when enumerating
the innumerable causes which generally separate men from
the love of Christ and from the love of God in Christ Jesus
(to all of which, the love that was in himself rose superior),
did not set down argument among the grounds of separation.
For observe that he says, firstly: “Who shall separate us from
the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution,
or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? (as it is
written, For Thy sake we are killed all the day long; we
are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.) Nay, in all these
things we are more than conquerors through Him that loved
us.”<a id='r1128'></a><a href='#f1128' class='c007'><sup>[1128]</sup></a> And secondly, when laying down another series of
causes which naturally tend to separate those who are not
firmly grounded in their religion, he says: “For I am persuaded
that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities,
nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,
nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able
to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus
our Lord.”<a id='r1129'></a><a href='#f1129' class='c007'><sup>[1129]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>4. Now, truly, it is proper that <i>we</i> should feel elated
because afflictions, or those other causes enumerated by Paul,
do not separate us [from Christ]; but not that Paul and the
other apostles, and any other resembling them, [should entertain
that feeling], because they were far exalted above such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>things when they said, “In all these things we are <i>more</i> than
conquerors through Him that loved us,”<a id='r1130'></a><a href='#f1130' class='c007'><sup>[1130]</sup></a> which is a stronger
statement than that they are simply “conquerors.” But if it
be proper for apostles to entertain a feeling of elation in not
being separated from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus
our Lord, that feeling will be entertained by them because
neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor any of
the things that follow, can separate them from the love of God
which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. And therefore I do not
congratulate that believer in Christ whose faith can be shaken
by Celsus—who no longer shares the common life of men,
but has long since departed—or by any apparent plausibility
of argument.<a id='r1131'></a><a href='#f1131' class='c007'><sup>[1131]</sup></a> For I do not know in what rank to place
him who has need of arguments written in books in answer
to the charges of Celsus against the Christians, in order
to prevent him from being shaken in his faith, and confirm
him in it. But nevertheless, since in the multitude
of those who are considered believers some such persons
might be found as would have their faith shaken and overthrown
by the writings of Celsus, but who might be preserved
by a reply to them of such a nature as to refute his
statements and to exhibit the truth, we have deemed it
right to yield to your injunction, and to furnish an answer
to the treatise which you sent us, but which I do not think
that any one, although only a short way advanced in philosophy,
will allow to be a “True Discourse,” as Celsus has
entitled it.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. Paul, indeed, observing that there are in Greek philosophy
certain things not to be lightly esteemed, which are
plausible in the eyes of the many, but which represent falsehood
as truth, says with regard to such: “Beware lest any
man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after
the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and
not after Christ.”<a id='r1132'></a><a href='#f1132' class='c007'><sup>[1132]</sup></a> And seeing that there was a kind of
greatness manifest in the words of the world’s wisdom, he
said that the words of the philosophers were “according to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>the rudiments of the world.” No man of sense, however,
would say that those of Celsus were “according to the rudiments
of the world.” Now those words, which contained
some element of deceitfulness, the apostle named “vain
deceit,” probably by way of distinction from a deceit that was
not “vain;” and the prophet Jeremiah observing this, ventured
to say to God, “O Lord, Thou hast deceived me, and I
was deceived; Thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed.”<a id='r1133'></a><a href='#f1133' class='c007'><sup>[1133]</sup></a>
But in the language of Celsus there seems to me to be no
deceitfulness at all, not even that which is “vain;” such
deceitfulness, viz., as is found in the language of those who
have founded philosophical sects, and who have been endowed
with no ordinary talent for such pursuits. And as no one
would say that any ordinary error in geometrical demonstrations
was intended to deceive, or would describe it for the sake
of exercise in such matters;<a id='r1134'></a><a href='#f1134' class='c007'><sup>[1134]</sup></a> so those opinions which are to
be styled “vain deceit,” and the “tradition of men,” and
“according to the rudiments of the world,” must have some
resemblance to the views of those who have been the founders
of philosophical sects, [if such titles are to be appropriately
applied to them].</p>

<p class='c006'>6. After proceeding with this work as far as the place
where Celsus introduces the Jew disputing with Jesus, I
resolved to prefix this preface to the beginning [of the
treatise], in order that the reader of our reply to Celsus
might fall in with it first, and see that this book has been
composed not for those who are thorough believers, but for
such as are either wholly unacquainted with the Christian
faith, or for those who, as the apostle terms them, are “weak
in the faith;” regarding whom he says, “Him that is weak in
the faith receive ye.”<a id='r1135'></a><a href='#f1135' class='c007'><sup>[1135]</sup></a> And this preface must be my apology
for beginning my answer to Celsus on one plan, and carrying
it on on another. For my first intention was to indicate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>his principal objections, and then briefly the answers that
were returned to them, and subsequently to make a systematic
treatise of the whole discourse.<a id='r1136'></a><a href='#f1136' class='c007'><sup>[1136]</sup></a> But afterwards, circumstances
themselves suggested to me that I should be economical of
my time, and that, satisfied with what I had already stated at
the commencement, I should in the following part grapple
closely, to the best of my ability, with the charges of Celsus.
I have therefore to ask indulgence for those portions which
follow the preface towards the beginning of the book. And
if you are not impressed by the powerful arguments which
succeed, then, asking similar indulgence also with respect to
them, I refer you, if you still desire an argumentative solution
of the objections of Celsus, to those men who are wiser
than myself, and who are able by words and treatises to
overthrow the charges which he brings against us. But
better is the man who, although meeting with the work of
Celsus, needs no answer to it at all, but who despises all its
contents, since they are contemned, and with good reason, by
every believer in Christ, through the Spirit that is in him.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='one'>I.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>The first point which Celsus brings forward, in his desire
to throw discredit upon Christianity, is, that the Christians
entered into secret associations with each other contrary to
law, saying, that “of associations some are public, and that
these are in accordance with the laws; others, again, secret,
and maintained in violation of the laws.” And his wish is to
bring into disrepute what are termed the “love-feasts”<a id='r1137'></a><a href='#f1137' class='c007'><sup>[1137]</sup></a> of
the Christians, as if they had their origin in the common
danger, and were more binding than any oaths. Since, then,
he babbles about the public law, alleging that the associations
of the Christians are in violation of it, we have to reply, that
if a man were placed among Scythians, whose laws were unholy,<a id='r1138'></a><a href='#f1138' class='c007'><sup>[1138]</sup></a>
and having no opportunity of escape, were compelled
to live among them, such an one would with good reason, for
the sake of the law of truth, which the Scythians would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>regard as wickedness,<a id='r1139'></a><a href='#f1139' class='c007'><sup>[1139]</sup></a> enter into associations contrary to their
laws, with those like-minded with himself; so, if truth is
to decide, the laws of the heathens which relate to images,
and an atheistical polytheism, are “Scythian” laws, or more
impious even than these, if there be any such. It is not
irrational, then, to form associations in opposition to existing
laws, if done for the sake of the truth. For as those persons
would do well who should enter into a secret association in
order to put to death a tyrant who had seized upon the
liberties of a state, so Christians also, when tyrannized over by
him who is called the devil, and by falsehood, form leagues
contrary to the laws of the devil, against his power, and for
the safety of those others whom they may succeed in persuading
to revolt from a government which is, as it were,
“Scythian,” and despotic.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='two'>II.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>Celsus next proceeds to say, that the system of doctrine, viz.
Judaism, upon which Christianity depends, was barbarous in
its origin. And with an appearance of fairness, he does not
reproach Christianity<a id='r1140'></a><a href='#f1140' class='c007'><sup>[1140]</sup></a> because of its origin among barbarians,
but gives the latter credit for their ability in discovering [such]
doctrines. To this, however, he adds the statement, that the
Greeks are more skilful than any others in judging, establishing,
and reducing to practice the discoveries of barbarous
nations. Now this is our answer to his allegations, and our
defence of the truths contained in Christianity, that if any
one were to come from the study of Grecian opinions and
usages to the gospel, he would not only decide that its doctrines
were true, but would by practice establish their truth,
and supply whatever seemed wanting, from a Grecian point
of view, to their demonstration, and thus confirm the truth
of Christianity. We have to say, moreover, that the gospel
has a demonstration of its own, more divine than any established
by Grecian dialectics. And this diviner method is
called by the apostle the “manifestation of the Spirit and of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>power:” of “the Spirit,” on account of the prophecies, which
are sufficient to produce faith in any one who reads them,
especially in those things which relate to Christ; and of
“power,” because of the signs and wonders which we must
believe to have been performed, both on many other grounds,
and on this, that traces of them are still preserved among
those who regulate their lives by the precepts of the gospel.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='three'>III.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>After this, Celsus proceeding to speak of the Christians
teaching and practising their favourite doctrines in secret,
and saying that they do this to some purpose, seeing they
escape the penalty of death which is imminent, he compares
their dangers with those which were encountered by such
men as Socrates for the sake of philosophy; and here he
might have mentioned Pythagoras as well, and other philosophers.
But our answer to this is, that in the case of
Socrates the Athenians immediately afterwards repented;
and no feeling of bitterness remained in their minds regarding
him, as also happened in the history of Pythagoras.
The followers of the latter, indeed, for a considerable time
established their schools in that part of Italy called Magna
Græcia; but in the case of the Christians, the Roman Senate,
and the princes of the time, and the soldiery, and the people,
and the relatives of those who had become converts to the
faith, made war upon their doctrine, and would have prevented
[its progress], overcoming it by a confederacy of so
powerful a nature, had it not, by the help of God, escaped
the danger, and risen above it, so as [finally] to defeat the
whole world in its conspiracy against it.</p>
<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='four'>IV.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>Let us notice also how he thinks to cast discredit upon our
system of morals,<a id='r1141'></a><a href='#f1141' class='c007'><sup>[1141]</sup></a> alleging that it is only common to us with
other philosophers, and no venerable or new branch of instruction.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>In reply to which we have to say, that unless all
men had naturally impressed upon their minds sound ideas
of morality, the doctrine of the punishment of sinners would
have been excluded by those who bring upon themselves
the righteous judgments of God. It is not therefore matter
of surprise that the same God should have sown in the hearts
of all men those truths which He taught by the prophets
and the Saviour, in order that at the divine judgment every
man may be without excuse, having the “requirements<a id='r1142'></a><a href='#f1142' class='c007'><sup>[1142]</sup></a> of
the law written upon his heart,”—a truth obscurely alluded
to by the Bible<a id='r1143'></a><a href='#f1143' class='c007'><sup>[1143]</sup></a> in what the Greeks regard as a myth, where
it represents God as having with His own finger written
down the commandments, and given them to Moses, and
which the wickedness of the worshippers of the calf made
him break in pieces, as if the flood of wickedness, so to speak,
had swept them away. But Moses having again hewn tables
of stone, God wrote the commandments a second time, and
gave them to him; the prophetic word preparing the soul, as
it were, after the first transgression, for the writing of God
a second time.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='five'>V.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>Treating of the regulations respecting idolatry as being
peculiar to Christianity, Celsus establishes their correctness,
saying that the Christians do not consider those to be gods
that are made with hands, on the ground that it is not in
conformity with right reason [to suppose] that images,
fashioned by the most worthless and depraved of workmen,
and in many instances also provided by wicked men, can be
[regarded as] gods. In what follows, however, wishing to
show that this is a common opinion, and one not first discovered
by Christianity, he quotes a saying of Heraclitus to
this effect: “That those who draw near to lifeless images,
as if they were gods, act in a similar manner to those who
would enter into conversation with houses.” Respecting this,
then, we have to say, that ideas were implanted in the minds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>of men like the principles of morality, from which not only
Heraclitus, but any other Greek or barbarian, might by
reflection have deduced the same conclusion; for he states
that the Persians also were of the same opinion, quoting
Herodotus as his authority. We also can add to these Zeno
of Citium, who in his <i>Polity</i> says: “And there will be no
need to build temples, for nothing ought to be regarded
as sacred, or of much value, or holy, which is the work
of builders and of mean men.” It is evident, then, with
respect to this opinion [as well as others], that there has
been engraven upon the hearts of men by the finger of God
a sense of the duty that is required.</p>
<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='six'>VI.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>After this, through the influence of some motive which is
unknown to me, Celsus asserts that it is by the names of
certain demons, and by the use of incantations, that the
Christians appear to be possessed of [miraculous] power;
hinting, I suppose, at the practices of those who expel evil
spirits by incantations. And here he manifestly appears to
malign the gospel. For it is not by incantations that Christians
seem to prevail [over evil spirits], but by the name of
Jesus, accompanied by the announcement of the narratives
which relate to Him; for the repetition of these has frequently
been the means of driving demons out of men,
especially when those who repeated them did so in a sound
and genuinely believing spirit. Such power, indeed, does
the name of Jesus possess over evil spirits, that there have
been instances where it was effectual, when it was pronounced
even by bad men, which Jesus Himself taught [would be the
case], when He said: “Many shall say to me in that day,
In Thy name we have cast out devils, and done many wonderful
works.”<a id='r1144'></a><a href='#f1144' class='c007'><sup>[1144]</sup></a> Whether Celsus omitted this from intentional
malignity, or from ignorance, I do not know. And he
next proceeds to bring a charge against the Saviour Himself,
alleging that it was by means of sorcery that He was able to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>accomplish the wonders which He performed; and that foreseeing
that others would attain the same knowledge, and do
the same things, making a boast of doing them by help of
the power of God, He excludes such from His kingdom.
And his accusation is, that if they are justly excluded, while
He Himself is guilty of the same practices, He is a wicked
man; but if He is not guilty of wickedness in doing such
things, neither are they who do the same as He. But even
if it be impossible to show by what power Jesus wrought
these miracles, it is clear that Christians employ no spells
or incantations, but the simple name of Jesus, and certain
other words in which they repose faith, according to the Holy
Scriptures.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='seven'>VII.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>Moreover, since he frequently calls the Christian doctrine
a secret system [of belief], we must confute him on this point
also, since almost the entire world is better acquainted with
what Christians preach than with the favourite opinions of
philosophers. For who is ignorant of the statement that
Jesus was born of a virgin, and that He was crucified, and
that His resurrection is an article of faith among many, and
that a general judgment is announced to come, in which the
wicked are to be punished according to their deserts, and the
righteous to be duly rewarded? And yet the mystery of
the resurrection, not being understood,<a id='r1145'></a><a href='#f1145' class='c007'><sup>[1145]</sup></a> is made a subject of
ridicule among unbelievers. In these circumstances, to speak
of the Christian doctrine as a <i>secret</i> system, is altogether
absurd. But that there should be certain doctrines, not made
known to the multitude, which are [revealed] after the exoteric
ones have been taught, is not a peculiarity of Christianity
alone, but also of philosophic systems, in which certain truths
are exoteric and others esoteric. Some of the hearers of
Pythagoras were content with his <i>ipse dixit</i>; while others
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>were taught in secret those doctrines which were not deemed
fit to be communicated to profane and insufficiently prepared
ears. Moreover, all the mysteries that are celebrated everywhere
throughout Greece and barbarous countries, although
held in secret, have no discredit thrown upon them, so that
it is in vain that he endeavours to calumniate the secret
doctrines of Christianity, seeing he does not correctly understand
its nature.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='eight'>VIII.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c015'>It is with a certain eloquence,<a id='r1146'></a><a href='#f1146' class='c007'><sup>[1146]</sup></a> indeed, that he appears to
advocate the cause of those who bear witness to the truth of
Christianity by their death, in the following words: “And I
do not maintain that if a man, who has adopted a system of
good doctrine, is to incur danger from men on that account,
he should either apostatize, or feign apostasy, or openly deny
his opinions.” And he condemns those who, while holding
the Christian views, either pretend that they do not, or deny
them, saying that “he who holds a certain opinion ought not
to feign recantation, or publicly disown it.” And here Celsus
must be convicted of self-contradiction. For from other
treatises of his it is ascertained that he was an Epicurean;
but here, because he thought that he could assail Christianity
with better effect by not professing the opinions of Epicurus,
he pretends that there is a something better in man than
the earthly part of his nature, which is akin to God, and
says that “they in whom this element, viz. the soul, is in a
healthy condition, are ever seeking after their kindred nature,
meaning God, and are ever desiring to hear something about
Him, and to call it to remembrance.” Observe now the insincerity
of his character! Having said a little before, that
“the man who had embraced a system of good doctrine ought
not, even if exposed to danger on that account from men, to
disavow it, or pretend that he had done so, nor yet openly
disown it,” he now involves himself in all manner of contradictions.
For he knew that if he acknowledged himself an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>Epicurean, he would not obtain any credit when accusing
those who, in any degree, introduce the doctrine of Providence,
and who place a God over the world. And we
have heard that there were two individuals of the name of
Celsus, both of whom were Epicureans; the earlier of the
two having lived in the time of Nero, but this one in that of
Adrian, and later.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='nine'>IX.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>He next proceeds to recommend, that in adopting opinions
we should follow reason and a rational guide,<a id='r1147'></a><a href='#f1147' class='c007'><sup>[1147]</sup></a> since he who
assents to opinions without following this course is very liable
to be deceived. And he compares inconsiderate believers to
Metragyrtæ, and soothsayers, and Mithræ, and Sabbadians,
and to anything else that one may fall in with, and to the
phantoms of Hecate, or any other demon or demons. For
as amongst such persons are frequently to be found wicked
men, who, taking advantage of the ignorance of those who
are easily deceived, lead them away whither they will, so also,
he says, is the case among Christians. And he asserts that
certain persons who do not wish either to give or receive a
reason for their belief, keep repeating, “Do not examine,
but believe!” and, “Your faith will save you!” And he
alleges that such also say, “The wisdom of this life is bad,
but that foolishness is a good thing!” To which we have
to answer, that if it were possible for all to leave the business
of life, and devote themselves to philosophy, no other method
ought to be adopted by any one, but this alone. For in the
Christian system also it will be found that there is, not to
speak at all arrogantly, at least as much of investigation into
articles of belief, and of explanation of dark sayings, occurring
in the prophetical writings, and of the parables in the
Gospels, and of countless other things, which either were
narrated or enacted with a symbolical signification,<a id='r1148'></a><a href='#f1148' class='c007'><sup>[1148]</sup></a> [as is
the case with other systems]. But since the course alluded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>to is impossible, partly on account of the necessities of life,
partly on account of the weakness of men, as only a very
few individuals devote themselves earnestly to study,<a id='r1149'></a><a href='#f1149' class='c007'><sup>[1149]</sup></a> what
better method could be devised with a view of assisting the
multitude, than that which was delivered by Jesus to the
heathen? And let us inquire, with respect to the great
multitude of believers, who have washed away the mire of
wickedness in which they formerly wallowed, whether it
were better for them to believe without a reason, and [so] to
have become reformed and improved in their habits, through
the belief that men are chastised for sins, and honoured
for good works; or not to have allowed themselves to be converted
on the strength of mere faith, but [to have waited]
until they could give themselves to a thorough examination
of the [necessary] reasons. For it is manifest that, [on such
a plan], all men, with very few exceptions, would not obtain
this [amelioration of conduct] which they have obtained
through a simple faith, but would continue to remain in the
practice of a wicked life. Now, whatever other evidence
can be furnished of the fact, that it was not without divine
intervention that the philanthropic scheme of Christianity
was introduced among men, this also must be added. For a
pious man will not believe that even a physician of the body,
who restores the sick to better health, could take up his abode
in any city or country without divine permission, since no
good happens to men without the help of God. And if he
who has cured the <i>bodies</i> of many, or restored them to better
health, does not effect his cures without the help of God,
how much more He who has healed the <i>souls</i> of many,
and has turned them [to virtue], and improved their nature,
and attached them to God who is over all things, and taught
them to refer every action to His good pleasure, and to shun
all that is displeasing to Him, even to the least of their words
or deeds, or even of the thoughts of their hearts?</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>
  <h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='ten'>X.</abbr></h4>
</div>
<p class='c005'>In the next place, since our opponents keep repeating those
statements about faith, we must say that, considering it as
a useful thing for the multitude, we admit that we teach
those men to believe without reasons, who are unable to
abandon all other employments, and give themselves to an
examination of arguments; and our opponents, although they
do not acknowledge it, yet practically do the same. For
who is there that, on betaking himself to the study of philosophy,
and throwing himself into the ranks of some sect,
either by chance,<a id='r1150'></a><a href='#f1150' class='c007'><sup>[1150]</sup></a> or because he is provided with a teacher of
that school, adopts such a course for any other reason, except
that he <i>believes</i> his particular sect to be superior to any other?
For, not waiting to hear the arguments of all the other
philosophers, and of all the different sects, and the reasons
for condemning one system and for supporting another, he
in this way elects to become a Stoic, <i>e.g.</i>, or a Platonist, or a
Peripatetic, or an Epicurean, or a follower of some other
school, and is thus borne, although they will not admit it, by
a kind of irrational impulse to the practice, say of Stoicism,
to the disregard of the others; despising either Platonism, as
being marked by greater humility than the others; or Peripateticism,
as more human, and as admitting with more
fairness<a id='r1151'></a><a href='#f1151' class='c007'><sup>[1151]</sup></a> than other systems the blessings of human life.
And some also, alarmed at first sight<a id='r1152'></a><a href='#f1152' class='c007'><sup>[1152]</sup></a> about the doctrine of
providence, from seeing what happens in the world to the
vicious and to the virtuous, have rashly concluded that there
is no divine providence at all, and have adopted the views of
Epicurus and Celsus.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='eleven'>XI.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>Since, then, as reason teaches, we must repose faith in
some one of those who have been the introducers of sects
among the Greeks or barbarians, why should we not rather
believe in God who is over all things, and in Him who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>teaches that worship is due to God alone, and that other
things are to be passed by, either as non-existent, or as existing
indeed, and worthy of honour, but not of worship and
reverence? And respecting these things, he who not only
believes, but who contemplates things with the eye of reason,
will state the demonstrations that occur to him, and which are
the result of careful investigation. And why should it not
be more reasonable, seeing all human things are dependent
upon faith, to believe God rather than them? For who
enters on a voyage, or contracts a marriage, or becomes the
father of children, or casts seed into the ground, without
believing that better things will result from so doing, although
the contrary might and sometimes does happen? And yet
the belief that better things, even agreeably to their wishes,
will follow, makes all men venture upon uncertain enterprises,
which may turn out differently from what they expect. And
if the hope and belief of a better future be the support of
life in every uncertain enterprise, why shall not this faith
rather be rationally accepted by him who believes on better
grounds than he who sails the sea, or tills the ground, or
marries a wife, or engages in any other human pursuit, in
the existence of a God who was the Creator of all these
things, and in Him who with surpassing wisdom and divine
greatness of mind dared to make known this doctrine to men
in every part of the world, at the cost of great danger, and
of a death considered infamous, which He underwent for the
sake of the human race; having also taught those who were
persuaded to embrace His doctrine at the first, to proceed,
under the peril of every danger, and of ever impending
death, to all quarters of the world to ensure the salvation of
men?</p>
<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='twelve'>XII.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>In the next place, when Celsus says in express words, “If
they would answer me, not as if I were asking for information,
for I am acquainted with all their opinions, but because
I take an equal interest in them all, it would be well. And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>if they will not, but will keep reiterating, as they generally
do, ‘Do not investigate,’ etc., they must, he continues, explain
to me at least of what nature these things are of which
they speak, and whence they are derived,” etc. Now, with
regard to his statement that he “is acquainted with all our
doctrines,” we have to say that this is a boastful and daring
assertion; for if he had read the prophets in particular,
which are full of acknowledged difficulties, and of declarations
that are obscure to the multitude, and if he had perused
the parables of the Gospels, and the other writings of the
law and of the Jewish history, and the utterances of the
apostles, and had read them candidly, with a desire to enter
into their meaning, he would not have expressed himself with
such boldness, nor said that he “was acquainted with all
their doctrines.” Even we ourselves, who have devoted much
study to these writings, would not say that “we were acquainted
with everything,” for we have a regard for truth.
Not one of us will assert, “I know all the doctrines of Epicurus,”
or will be confident that he knows all those of Plato,
in the knowledge of the fact that so many differences of
opinion exist among the expositors of these systems. For
who is so daring as to say that he knows all the opinions of
the Stoics or of the Peripatetics? Unless, indeed, it should
be the case that he has heard this boast, “I know them all,”
from some ignorant and senseless individuals, who do not
perceive their own ignorance, and should thus imagine, from
having had such persons as his teachers, that he was acquainted
with them all. Such an one appears to me to act
very much as a person would do who had visited Egypt (where
the Egyptian <i>savans</i>, learned in their country’s literature, are
greatly given to philosophizing about those things which are
regarded among them as divine, but where the vulgar, hearing
certain myths, the reasons of which they do not understand,
are greatly elated because of their fancied knowledge), and
who should imagine that he is acquainted with the whole circle
of Egyptian knowledge, after having been a disciple of the
ignorant alone, and without having associated with any of the
priests, or having learned the mysteries of the Egyptians from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>any other source. And what I have said regarding the learned
and ignorant among the Egyptians, I might have said also of
the Persians; among whom there are mysteries, conducted on
rational principles by the learned among them, but understood
in a symbolical sense by the more superficial of the multitude.<a id='r1153'></a><a href='#f1153' class='c007'><sup>[1153]</sup></a>
And the same remark applies to the Syrians, and Indians,
and to all those who have a literature and a mythology.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='thirteen'>XIII.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>But since Celsus has declared it to be a saying of many
Christians, that “the wisdom of this life is a bad thing, but
that foolishness is good,” we have to answer that he slanders
the gospel, not giving the words as they actually occur in
the writings of Paul, where they run as follow: “If any one
among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become
a fool, that he may become wise. For the wisdom of this
world is foolishness with God.”<a id='r1154'></a><a href='#f1154' class='c007'><sup>[1154]</sup></a> The apostle, therefore,
does not say simply that “wisdom is foolishness with God,”
but “the wisdom of <i>this world</i>.” And again, not, “If any
one among you seemeth to be wise, let him become a fool
universally;” but, “let him become a fool <i>in this world</i>,
that he may become wise.” We term, then, “the wisdom
of this world,” every false system of philosophy, which,
according to the Scriptures, is brought to nought; and
we call foolishness good, not without restriction, but when
a man becomes foolish as to <i>this world</i>. As if we were to
say that the Platonist, who believes in the immortality of
the soul, and in the doctrine of its metempsychosis,<a id='r1155'></a><a href='#f1155' class='c007'><sup>[1155]</sup></a> incurs
the charge of folly with the Stoics, who discard this opinion;
and with the Peripatetics, who babble about the subtleties
of Plato; and with the Epicureans, who call it superstition
to introduce a providence, and to place a God over all
things. Moreover, that it is in agreement with the spirit of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>Christianity, of much more importance to give our assent to
doctrines upon grounds of reason and wisdom than on that
of faith merely, and that it was only in certain circumstances
that the latter course was desired by Christianity, in
order not to leave men altogether without help, is shown by
that genuine disciple of Jesus, Paul, when he says: “For
after that, in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew
not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to
save them that believe.”<a id='r1156'></a><a href='#f1156' class='c007'><sup>[1156]</sup></a> Now by these words it is clearly
shown that it is by the wisdom of God that God ought to be
known. But as this result did not follow, it pleased God a
second time to save them that believe, not by “folly” <i>universally</i>,
but by such foolishness as depended on preaching.
For the preaching of Jesus Christ as crucified is the “foolishness”
of preaching, as Paul also perceived, when he said,
“But we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling-block,
and to the Greeks foolishness; but to them who are
called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and
wisdom of God.”<a id='r1157'></a><a href='#f1157' class='c007'><sup>[1157]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='fourteen'>XIV.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>Celsus, being of opinion that there is to be found among
many nations a general relationship of doctrine, enumerates
all the nations which gave rise to such and such opinions;
but for some reason, unknown to me, he casts a slight upon
the Jews, not including them amongst the others, as having
either laboured along with them, and arrived at the same
conclusions, or as having entertained similar opinions on
many subjects. It is proper, therefore, to ask him why he
gives credence to the histories of barbarians and Greeks
respecting the antiquity of those nations of whom he speaks,
but stamps the histories of this nation alone as false. For
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>if the respective writers related the events which are found
in these works in the spirit of truth, why should we distrust
the prophets of the Jews alone? And if Moses and the
prophets have recorded many things in their history from
a desire to favour their own system, why should we not say
the same of the historians of other countries? Or, when the
Egyptians or their histories speak evil of the Jews, are they
to be believed on that point; but the Jews, when saying the
same things of the Egyptians, and declaring that they had
suffered great injustice at their hands, and that on this account
they had been persecuted by God, are to be charged
with falsehood? And this applies not to the Egyptians
alone, but to others; for we shall find that there was a connection
between the Assyrians and the Jews, and that this
is recorded in the ancient histories of the Assyrians. And
so also the Jewish historians (I avoid using the word “prophets,”
that I may not appear to prejudge the case) have
related that the Assyrians were enemies of the Jews. Observe
at once, then, the arbitrary procedure of this individual,
who believes the histories of these nations on the ground of
their being learned, and condemns others as being wholly
ignorant. For listen to the statement of Celsus: “There
is,” he says, “an authoritative account from the very beginning,
respecting which there is a constant agreement among
all the most learned nations, and cities, and men.” And yet
will not call the Jews a learned nation in the same way in
which he does the Egyptians, and Assyrians, and Indians, and
Persians, and Odrysians, and Samothracians, and Eleusinians.</p>
<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='fifteen'>XV.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>How much more impartial than Celsus is Numenius the
Pythagorean, who has given many proofs of being a very
eloquent man, and who has carefully tested many opinions,
and collected together from many sources what had the
appearance of truth; for, in the first book of his treatise <i>On
the Good</i>, speaking of those nations who have adopted the
opinion that God is incorporeal, he enumerates the Jews
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>also among those who hold this view; not showing any
reluctance to use even the language of their prophets in
his treatise, and to give it a metaphorical signification. It
is said, moreover, that Hermippus has recorded in his first
book, <i>On Lawgivers</i>, that it was from the Jewish people that
Pythagoras derived the philosophy which he introduced among
the Greeks. And there is extant a work by the historian
Hecatæus, treating of the Jews, in which so high a character
is bestowed upon that nation for its learning, that Herennius
Philo, in his treatise on the Jews, has doubts, in the first
place, whether it is really the composition of the historian;
and says, in the second place, that if really his, it is probable
that he was carried away by the plausible nature of the
Jewish history, and so yielded his assent to their system.</p>
<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='sixteen'>XVI.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>I must express my surprise that Celsus should class the
Odrysians, and Samothracians, and Eleusinians, and Hyperboreans
among the most ancient and learned nations, and
should not deem the Jews worthy of a place among such,
either for their learning or their antiquity, although there
are many treatises in circulation among the Egyptians, and
Phœnicians, and Greeks, which testify to their existence as
an ancient people, but which I have considered it unnecessary
to quote. For any one who chooses may read what Flavius
Josephus has recorded in his two books, <i>On the Antiquity
of the Jews</i>, where he brings together a great collection of
writers, who bear witness to the antiquity of the Jewish
people; and there exists the <i>Discourse to the Greeks</i> of
Tatian the younger, in which with very great learning he
enumerates those historians who have treated of the antiquity
of the Jewish nation and of Moses. It seems, then, to be
not from a love of truth, but from a spirit of hatred, that
Celsus makes these statements, his object being to asperse
the origin of Christianity, which is connected with Judaism.
Nay, he styles the Galactophagi of Homer, and the Druids
of the Gauls, and the Getæ, most learned and ancient tribes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>on account of the resemblance between their traditions and
those of the Jews, although I know not whether any of their
histories survive; but the Hebrews alone, as far as in him
lies, he deprives of the honour both of antiquity and learning.
And again, when making a list of ancient and learned men
who have conferred benefits upon their contemporaries [by
their deeds], and upon posterity by their writings, he excluded
Moses from the number; while of Linus, to whom Celsus
assigns a foremost place in his list, there exist neither laws
nor discourses which produced a change for the better among
any tribes; whereas a whole nation, dispersed throughout
the entire world, obey the laws of Moses. Consider, then,
whether it is not from open malevolence that he has expelled
Moses from his catalogue of learned men, while asserting
that Linus, and Musæus, and Orpheus, and Pherecydes, and
the Persian Zoroaster, and Pythagoras, discussed these topics,
and that their opinions were deposited in books, and have
thus been preserved down to the present time. And it is
intentionally also that he has omitted to take notice of the
myth, embellished chiefly by Orpheus, in which the gods are
described as affected by human weaknesses and passions.</p>
<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='seventeen'>XVII.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>In what follows, Celsus, assailing the Mosaic history, finds
fault with those who give it a tropical and allegorical signification.
And here one might say to this great man, who
inscribed upon his own work the title of a <i>True Discourse</i>,
“Why, good sir, do you make it a boast to have it recorded
that the gods should engage in such adventures as
are described by your learned poets and philosophers, and
be guilty of abominable intrigues, and of engaging in wars
against their own fathers, and of cutting off their secret parts,
and should dare to commit and to suffer such enormities;
while Moses, who gives no such accounts respecting God, nor
even regarding the holy angels, and who relates deeds of far
less atrocity regarding men (for in his writings no one ever
ventured to commit such crimes as Kronos did against Uranus,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>or Zeus against his father, or that of the father of men and
gods, who had intercourse with his own daughter), should be
considered as having deceived those who were placed under
his laws, and to have led them into error?” And here Celsus
seems to me to act somewhat as Thrasymachus the Platonic
philosopher did, when he would not allow Socrates to answer
regarding justice, as he wished, but said, “Take care not to
say that utility is justice, or duty, or anything of that kind.”
For in like manner Celsus assails (as he thinks) the Mosaic
histories, and finds fault with those who understand them
allegorically, at the same time bestowing also some praise
upon those who do so, to the effect that they are more impartial
[than those who do not]; and thus, as it were, he
prevents by his cavils those who are able to show the true
state of the case from offering such a defence as they would
wish to offer.<a id='r1158'></a><a href='#f1158' class='c007'><sup>[1158]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='eighteen'>XVIII.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>And challenging a comparison of book with book, I would
say, “Come now, good sir, take down the poems of Linus, and
of Musæus, and of Orpheus, and the writings of Pherecydes,
and carefully compare these with the laws of Moses—histories
with histories, and ethical discourses with laws and commandments—and
see which of the two are the better fitted to
change the character of the hearer on the very spot, and
which to harden<a id='r1159'></a><a href='#f1159' class='c007'><sup>[1159]</sup></a> him in his wickedness; and observe that
your series of writers display little concern for those readers
who are to peruse them at once unaided,<a id='r1160'></a><a href='#f1160' class='c007'><sup>[1160]</sup></a> but have composed
their philosophy (as you term it) for those who are able to
comprehend its metaphorical and allegorical signification;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>whereas Moses, like a distinguished orator who meditates
some figure of Rhetoric, and who carefully introduces in
every part language of twofold meaning, has done this in
his five books: neither affording, in the portion which relates
to morals, any handle to his Jewish subjects for committing
evil; nor yet giving to the few individuals who were endowed
with greater wisdom, and who were capable of investigating
his meaning, a treatise devoid of material for speculation.
But of your learned poets the very writings would seem no
longer to be preserved, although they would have been carefully
treasured up if the readers had perceived any benefit
[likely to be derived from them]; whereas the works of
Moses have stirred up many, who were even aliens to the
manners of the Jews, to the belief that, as these writings
testify, the first who enacted these laws and delivered them
to Moses, was the God who was the Creator of the world.
For it became the Creator of the universe, after laying down
laws for its government, to confer upon His words a power
which might subdue all men in every part of the earth.
And this I maintain, having as yet entered into no investigation
regarding Jesus, but still demonstrating that Moses,
who is far inferior to the Lord, is, as the <i>Discourse</i> will show,
greatly superior to your wise poets and philosophers.”</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='nineteen'>XIX.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>After these statements, Celsus, from a secret desire to cast
discredit upon the Mosaic account of the creation, which
teaches that the world is not yet ten thousand years old, but
very much under that, while concealing his wish, intimates
his agreement with those who hold that the world is uncreated.
For, maintaining that there have been, from all eternity,
many conflagrations and many deluges, and that the flood
which lately took place in the time of Deucalion is comparatively
modern, he clearly demonstrates to those who are able
to understand him, that, in his opinion, the world was uncreated.
But let this assailant of the Christian faith tell us
by what arguments he was compelled to accept the statement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>that there have been many conflagrations and many cataclysms,
and that the flood which occurred in the time of
Deucalion, and the conflagration in that of Phæthon, were
more recent than any others. And if he should put forward
the dialogues of Plato [as evidence] on these subjects, we
shall say to him that it is allowable for us also to believe
that there resided in the pure and pious soul of Moses, who
ascended above all created things, and united himself to the
Creator of the universe, and who made known divine things
with far greater clearness than Plato, or those other wise
men [who lived] among the Greeks and Romans, a spirit
which was divine. And if he demand of us our reasons for
such a belief, let him first give grounds for his own unsupported
assertions, and then we shall show that this view of
ours is the correct one.</p>
<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='twenty'>XX.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>And yet, against his will, Celsus is entangled into testifying
that the world is comparatively modern, and not yet
ten thousand years old, when he says that the Greeks consider
those things as ancient, because, owing to the deluges
and conflagrations, they have not beheld or received any
memorials of older events. But let Celsus have, as his
authorities for the myth regarding the conflagrations and
inundations, those persons who, in his opinion, are the most
learned of the Egyptians, traces of whose wisdom are to be
found in the worship of irrational animals, and in arguments
which prove that such a worship of God is in conformity
with reason, and of a secret and mysterious character. The
Egyptians, then, when they boastfully give their own account
of the divinity of animals, are to be considered wise; but if
any Jew, who has signified his adherence to the law and the
lawgiver, refer everything to the Creator of the universe,
and the only God, he is, in the opinion of Celsus and those
like him, deemed inferior to him who degrades the Divinity
not only to the level of rational and mortal animals, but even
to that of irrational also!—a view which goes far beyond the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>mythical doctrine of transmigration, according to which the
soul falls down from the summit of heaven, and enters into
the body of brute beasts, both tame and savage! And if the
Egyptians related fables of this kind, they are believed to
convey a philosophical meaning by their enigmas and mysteries;
but if Moses compose and leave behind him histories
and laws for an entire nation, they are to be considered as
empty fables, the language of which admits of no allegorical
meaning!</p>
<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='twenty-one'>XXI.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>The following is the view of Celsus and the Epicureans:
“Moses having,” he says, “learned the doctrine which is to
be found existing among wise nations and eloquent men,
obtained the reputation of divinity.” Now, in answer to this
we have to say, that it may be allowed him that Moses did
indeed hear a somewhat ancient doctrine, and transmitted
the same to the Hebrews; that if the doctrine which he
heard was false, and neither pious nor venerable, and if
notwithstanding, he received it and handed it down to those
under his authority, he is liable to censure; but if, as you
assert, he gave his adherence to opinions that were wise and
true, and educated his people by means of them, what, pray,
has he done deserving of condemnation? Would, indeed,
that not only Epicurus, but Aristotle, whose sentiments
regarding providence are not so impious [as those of the
former], and the Stoics, who assert that God is a body, had
heard such a doctrine! Then the world would not have been
filled with opinions which either disallow or enfeeble the action
of providence, or introduce a corrupt corporeal principle,
according to which the god of the Stoics is a body, with
respect to whom they are not afraid to say that he is capable
of change, and may be altered and transformed in all his
parts, and, generally, that he is capable of corruption, if
there be any one to corrupt him, but that he has the good
fortune to escape corruption, because there is none to corrupt.
Whereas the doctrine of the Jews and Christians, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>preserves the immutability and unalterableness of the divine
nature, is stigmatized as impious, because it does not partake
of the profanity of those whose notions of God are marked
by impiety, but because it says in the supplication addressed
to the Divinity, “Thou art the same,”<a id='r1161'></a><a href='#f1161' class='c007'><sup>[1161]</sup></a> it being, moreover,
an article of faith that God has said, “I change not.”<a id='r1162'></a><a href='#f1162' class='c007'><sup>[1162]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='twenty-two'>XXII.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>After this, Celsus, without condemning circumcision as
practised by the Jews, asserts that this usage was derived
from the Egyptians; thus believing the Egyptians rather
than Moses, who says that Abraham was the first among
men who practised the rite. And it is not Moses alone
who mentions the name of Abraham, assigning to him great
intimacy with God; but many also of those who give themselves
to the practice of the conjuration of evil spirits, employ
in their spells the expression “God of Abraham,” pointing
out by the very name the friendship [that existed] between
that just man and God. And yet, while making use of the
phrase “God of Abraham,” they do not know who Abraham
is! And the same remark applies to Isaac, and Jacob, and
Israel; which names, although confessedly Hebrew, are frequently
introduced by those Egyptians who profess to produce
some wonderful result by means of their knowledge.
The rite of circumcision, however, which began with Abraham,
and was discontinued by Jesus, who desired that His disciples
should not practise it, is not before us for explanation; for
the present occasion does not lead us to speak of such things,
but to make an effort to refute the charges brought against
the doctrine of the Jews by Celsus, who thinks that he will
be able the more easily to establish the falsity of Christianity,
if, by assailing its origin in Judaism, he can show that the
latter also is untrue.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>
  <h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='twenty-three'>XXIII.</abbr></h4>
</div>
<p class='c005'>After this, Celsus next asserts that “Those herdsmen and
shepherds who followed Moses as their leader, had their
minds deluded by vulgar deceits, and so supposed that there
was one God.” Let him show, then, how, after this irrational
departure, as he regards it, of the herdsmen and shepherds
from the worship of many gods, he himself is able to establish
the multiplicity of deities that are found amongst the Greeks,
or among those other nations that are called Barbarian.
Let him establish, therefore, the existence of Mnemosyne,
the mother of the Muses by Zeus; or of Themis, the parent
of the Hours; or let him prove that the ever naked Graces
can have a real, substantial existence. But he will not be
able to show, from any actions of theirs, that these fictitious
representations<a id='r1163'></a><a href='#f1163' class='c007'><sup>[1163]</sup></a> of the Greeks, which have the appearance of
being invested with bodies, are [really] gods. And why should
the fables of the Greeks regarding the gods be true, any more
than those of the Egyptians for example, who in their language
know nothing of a Mnemosyne, mother of the nine
Muses; nor of a Themis, parent of the Hours; nor of a
Euphrosyne, one of the Graces; nor of any other of these
names? How much more manifest (and how much better
than all these inventions!) is it that, convinced by what we
see, in the admirable order of the world, we should worship the
Maker of it as the one Author of one effect, and which, as being
wholly in harmony with itself, cannot on that account have
been the work of many makers; and that we should believe that
the whole heaven is not held together by the movements of
many souls, for one is enough, which bears the whole of the
non-wandering<a id='r1164'></a><a href='#f1164' class='c007'><sup>[1164]</sup></a> sphere from east to west, and embraces
within it all things which the world requires, and which are
not self-existing! For all are parts of the world, while God
is no part of the whole. But God cannot be imperfect, as a
part is imperfect. And perhaps profounder consideration
will show, that as God is not a part, so neither is He properly
the whole, since the whole is composed of parts; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>reason will not allow us to believe that the God who is over
all is composed of parts, each one of which cannot do what
all the other parts can.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='twenty-four'>XXIV.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>After this he continues: “These herdsmen and shepherds
concluded that there was but one God, named either the
Highest, or Adonai, or the Heavenly, or Sabaoth, or called
by some other of those names which they delight to give
this world; and they knew nothing beyond that.” And in
a subsequent part of his work he says, that “It makes no
difference whether the God who is over all things be called
by the name of Zeus, which is current among the Greeks, or
by that, <i>e.g.</i>, which is in use among the Indians or Egyptians.”
Now, in answer to this, we have to remark that this involves a
deep and mysterious subject—that, viz., respecting the nature
of names: it being a question whether, as Aristotle thinks,
names were bestowed by arrangement, or, as the Stoics hold,
by nature; the first words being imitations of things, agreeably
to which the names were formed, and in conformity
with which they introduce certain principles of etymology;
or whether, as Epicurus teaches (differing in this from the
Stoics), names were given by nature,—the first men having
uttered certain words varying with the circumstances in
which they found themselves. If, then, we shall be able to
establish, in reference to the preceding statement, the nature
of powerful names, some of which are used by the learned
amongst the Egyptians, or by the Magi among the Persians,
and by the Indian philosophers called Brahmans, or by the
Samanæans, and others in different countries; and shall be
able to make out that the so-called magic is not, as the
followers of Epicurus and Aristotle suppose, an altogether
uncertain thing, but is, as those skilled in it prove, a consistent
system, having words which are known to exceedingly
few; then we say that the name Sabaoth, and Adonai, and
the other names treated with so much reverence among the
Hebrews, are not applicable to any ordinary created things,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>but belong to a secret theology which refers to the Framer of
all things. These names, accordingly, when pronounced with
that attendant train of circumstances which is appropriate to
their nature, are possessed of great power; and other names,
again, current in the Egyptian tongue, are efficacious against
certain demons who can only do certain things; and other
names in the Persian language have corresponding power
over other spirits; and so on in every individual nation, for
different purposes. And thus it will be found that, of the
various demons upon the earth, to whom different localities
have been assigned, each one bears a name appropriate to
the several dialects of place and country. He, therefore, who
has a nobler idea, however small, of these matters, will be
careful not to apply differing names to different things; lest
he should resemble those who mistakenly apply the name of
God to lifeless matter, or who drag down the title of “the
Good” from the First Cause, or from virtue and excellence,
and apply it to blind Plutus, and to a healthy and well-proportioned
mixture of flesh and blood and bones, or to what is
considered to be noble birth.<a id='r1165'></a><a href='#f1165' class='c007'><sup>[1165]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='twenty-five'>XXV.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>And perhaps there is a danger as great as that which
degrades the name of “God,” or of “the Good,” to improper
objects, in changing the name of God according to a secret
system, and applying those which belong to inferior beings to
greater, and <i>vice versa</i>. And I do not dwell on this, that when
the name of Zeus is uttered, there is heard at the same time
that of the son of Kronos and Rhea, and the husband of
Hera, and brother of Poseidon, and father of Athene, and
Artemis, who was guilty of incest with his own daughter
Persephone; or that Apollo immediately suggests the son of
Leto and Zeus, and the brother of Artemis, and half-brother
of Hermes; and so with all the other names invented by these
wise men of Celsus, who are the parents of these opinions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>and the ancient theologians of the Greeks. For what are the
grounds for deciding that he should on the one hand be
properly called Zeus, and yet on the other should not have
Kronos for his father and Rhea for his mother? And the
same argument applies to all the others that are called gods.
But this charge does not at all apply to those who, for some
mysterious reason, refer the word Sabaoth, or Adonai, or any
of the other names to the [true] God. And when one is
able to philosophize about the mystery of names, he will find
much to say respecting the titles of the angels of God, of
whom one is called Michael, and another Gabriel, and another
Raphael, appropriately to the duties which they discharge in
the world, according to the will of the God of all things. And
a similar philosophy of names applies also to our Jesus, whose
name has already been seen, in an unmistakeable manner, to
have expelled myriads of evil spirits from the souls and bodies
[of men], so great was the power which it exerted upon those
from whom the spirits were driven out. And while still upon
the subject of names, we have to mention that those who are
skilled in the use of incantations, relate that the utterance of
the same incantation in its proper language can accomplish
what the spell professes to do; but when translated into any
other tongue, it is observed to become inefficacious and feeble.
And thus it is not the things signified, but the qualities and
peculiarities of words, which possess a certain power for this
or that purpose. And so on such grounds as these we defend
the conduct of the Christians, when they struggle even to
death to avoid calling God by the name of Zeus, or to give
Him a name from any other language. For they either use
the common name—God—indefinitely, or with some such
addition as that of the “Maker of all things,” “the Creator
of heaven and earth”—He who sent down to the human
race those good men, to whose names that of God being added,
certain mighty works are wrought among men. And much
more besides might be said on the subject of names, against
those who think that we ought to be indifferent as to our use
of them. And if the remark of Plato in the <i>Philebus</i> should
surprise us, when he says, “My fear, O Protagoras, about the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>names of the gods is no small one,” seeing Philebus in his discussion
with Socrates had called pleasure a “god,” how shall
we not rather approve the piety of the Christians, who apply
none of the names used in the mythologies to the Creator of
the world? And now enough on this subject for the present.</p>
<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='twenty-six'>XXVI.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>But let us see the manner in which this Celsus, who professes
to know everything, brings a false accusation against
the Jews, when he alleges that “they worship angels, and
are addicted to sorcery, in which Moses was their instructor.”
Now, in what part of the writings of Moses he
found the lawgiver laying down the worship of angels, let
him tell, who professes to know all about Christianity and
Judaism; and let him show also how sorcery can exist
among those who have accepted the Mosaic law, and read
the injunction, “Neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by
them.”<a id='r1166'></a><a href='#f1166' class='c007'><sup>[1166]</sup></a> Moreover, he promises to show afterwards “how it
was through ignorance that the Jews were deceived and led
into error.” Now, if he had discovered that the ignorance
of the Jews regarding Christ was the effect of their not
having heard the prophecies about Him, he would show
with truth how the Jews fell into error. But without any
wish whatever that this should appear, he views as Jewish
errors what are no errors at all. And Celsus having promised
to make us acquainted, in a subsequent part of his
work, with the doctrines of Judaism, proceeds in the first
place to speak of our Saviour as having been the leader of
our generation, in so far as we are Christians,<a id='r1167'></a><a href='#f1167' class='c007'><sup>[1167]</sup></a> and says that
“a few years ago he began to teach this doctrine, being
regarded by Christians as the Son of God.” Now, with
respect to this point—His prior existence a few years ago—we
have to remark as follows. Could it have come to pass
without divine assistance, that Jesus, desiring during these
years to spread abroad His words and teaching, should have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>been so successful, that everywhere throughout the world,
not a few persons, Greeks as well as Barbarians, learned as
well as ignorant, adopted His doctrine, so that they struggled
even to death in its defence, rather than deny it, which no
one is ever related to have done for any other system? I
indeed, from no wish to flatter<a id='r1168'></a><a href='#f1168' class='c007'><sup>[1168]</sup></a> Christianity, but from a
desire thoroughly to examine the facts, would say that even
those who are engaged in the healing of numbers of sick
persons, do not attain their object—the cure of the body—without
divine help; and if one were to succeed in
delivering souls from a flood of wickedness, and excesses,
and acts of injustice, and from a contempt of God, and
were to show, as evidence of such a result, one hundred
persons improved in their natures (let us suppose the number
to be so large), no one would reasonably say that it was
without divine assistance that he had implanted in those
hundred individuals a doctrine capable of removing so many
evils. And if any one, on a candid consideration of these
things, shall admit that no improvement ever takes place
among men without divine help, how much more confidently
shall he make the same assertion regarding Jesus, when he
compares the former lives of many converts to His doctrine
with their after conduct, and reflects in what acts of licentiousness
and injustice and covetousness they formerly indulged,
until, as Celsus, and they who think with him,
allege, “they were deceived,” and accepted a doctrine which,
as these individuals assert, is destructive of the life of men;
but who, from the time that they adopted it, have become in
some way meeker, and more religious, and more consistent,
so that certain among them, from a desire of exceeding
chastity, and a wish to worship God with greater purity,
abstain even from the permitted indulgences of [lawful] love.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='twenty-seven'>XXVII.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>Any one who examines the subject will see that Jesus
attempted and successfully accomplished works beyond the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>reach of human power. For although, from the very beginning,
all things opposed the spread of His doctrine in the
world,—both the princes of the times, and their chief captains
and generals, and all, to speak generally, who were
possessed of the smallest influence, and in addition to these, the
rulers of the different cities, and the soldiers, and the people,—yet
it proved victorious, as being the Word of God, the
nature of which is such that it cannot be hindered; and
becoming more powerful than all such adversaries, it made
itself master of the whole of Greece, and a considerable
portion of barbarian lands, and converted countless numbers
of souls to His religion. And although, among the multitude
of converts to Christianity, the simple and ignorant necessarily
outnumbered the more intelligent, as the former class
always does the latter, yet Celsus, unwilling to take note of
this, thinks that this philanthropic doctrine, which reaches to
every soul under the sun, is vulgar,<a id='r1169'></a><a href='#f1169' class='c007'><sup>[1169]</sup></a> and on account of its
vulgarity and its want of reasoning power, obtained a hold
only over the ignorant. And yet he himself admits that it
was not the simple alone who were led by the doctrine of
Jesus to adopt His religion; for he acknowledges that there
were amongst them some persons of moderate intelligence,
and gentle disposition, and possessed of understanding, and
capable of comprehending allegories.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='twenty-eight'>XXVIII.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>And since, in imitation of a rhetorician training a pupil,
he introduces a Jew, who enters into a personal discussion
with Jesus, and speaks in a very childish manner, altogether
unworthy of the grey hairs of a philosopher, let me
endeavour, to the best of my ability, to examine his statements,
and show that he does not maintain, throughout the
discussion, the consistency due to the character of a Jew.
For he represents him disputing with Jesus, and confuting
Him, as he thinks, on many points; and in the first place, he
accuses Him of having “invented his birth from a virgin,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>and upbraids Him with being “born in a certain Jewish
village, of a poor woman of the country, who gained her
subsistence by spinning, and who was turned out of doors by
her husband, a carpenter by trade, because she was convicted
of adultery; that after being driven away by her husband,
and wandering about for a time, she disgracefully gave birth
to Jesus, an illegitimate child, who having hired himself out
as a servant in Egypt on account of his poverty, and having
there acquired some miraculous powers, on which the Egyptians
greatly pride themselves, returned to his own country,
highly elated on account of them, and by means of these proclaimed
himself a God.” Now, as I cannot allow anything
said by unbelievers to remain unexamined, but must investigate
everything from the beginning, I give it as my opinion
that all these things worthily harmonize with the predictions
that Jesus is the Son of God.</p>
<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='twenty-nine'>XXIX.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>For birth is an aid towards an individual’s becoming
famous, and distinguished, and talked about; viz., when a
man’s parents happen to be in a position of rank and influence,
and are possessed of wealth, and are able to spend it upon the
education of their son, and when the country of one’s birth
is great and illustrious; but when a man having all these
things against him is able, notwithstanding these hindrances,
to make himself known, and to produce an impression on
those who hear of him, and to become distinguished and
visible to the whole world, which speaks of him as it did not
do before, how can we help admiring such a nature as being
both noble in itself, and devoting itself to great deeds, and possessing
a courage which is not by any means to be despised?
And if one were to examine more fully the history of such an
individual, why should he not seek to know in what manner,
after being reared up in frugality and poverty, and without
receiving any complete education, and without having studied
systems and opinions by means of which he might have
acquired confidence to associate with multitudes, and play
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>the demagogue, and attract to himself many hearers, he
nevertheless devoted himself to the teaching of new opinions,
introducing among men a doctrine which not only subverted
the customs of the Jews, while preserving due respect for
their prophets, but which especially overturned the established
observances of the Greeks regarding the Divinity?
And how could such a person—one who had been so brought
up, and who, as his calumniators admit, had learned nothing
great from men—have been able to teach, in a manner not
at all to be despised, such doctrines as he did regarding the
divine judgment, and the punishments that are to overtake
wickedness, and the rewards that are to be conferred upon
virtue; so that not only rustic and ignorant individuals were
won by his words, but also not a few of those who were
distinguished by their wisdom, and who were able to discern
the hidden meaning in those more common doctrines, as they
were considered, which were in circulation, and which secret
meaning enwrapped, so to speak, some more recondite signification
still? The Seriphian, in Plato, who reproaches
Themistocles after he had become celebrated for his military
skill, saying that his reputation was due not to his own
merits, but to his good fortune in having been born in the
most illustrious country in Greece, received from the good-natured
Athenian, who saw that his native country did contribute
to his renown, the following reply: “Neither would
I, had I been a Seriphian, have been so distinguished as I
am, nor would you have been a Themistocles, even if you
had had the good fortune to be an Athenian!” And now,
our Jesus, who is reproached with being born in a village,
and that not a Greek one, nor belonging to any nation widely
esteemed, and being despised as the son of a poor labouring
woman, and as having on account of his poverty left his
native country and hired himself out in Egypt, and being,
to use the instance already quoted, not only a Seriphian, as
it were, a native of a very small and undistinguished island,
but even, so to speak, the meanest of the Seriphians, has yet
been able to shake<a id='r1170'></a><a href='#f1170' class='c007'><sup>[1170]</sup></a> the whole inhabited world not only to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>a degree far above what Themistocles the Athenian ever
did, but beyond what even Pythagoras or Plato, or any other
wise man in any part of the world whatever, or any prince or
general, ever succeeded in doing.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='thirty'>XXX.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>Now, would not any one who investigated with ordinary
care the nature of these facts, be struck with amazement
at this man’s victory?—with his complete success in surmounting
by his reputation all causes that tended to bring
him into disrepute, and with his superiority over all other
illustrious individuals in the world? And yet it is a rare
thing for distinguished men to succeed in acquiring a reputation
for several things at once. For one man is admired
on account of his wisdom, another for his military skill, and
some of the barbarians for their marvellous powers of incantation,
and some for one quality, and others for another; but
not many have been admired and acquired a reputation for
many things at the same time; whereas this man, in addition
to his other merits, is an object of admiration both for his
wisdom, and for his miracles, and for his power of government.
For he persuaded some to withdraw themselves from
their laws, and to secede to him, not as a tyrant would do, nor
as a robber, who arms<a id='r1171'></a><a href='#f1171' class='c007'><sup>[1171]</sup></a> his followers against men; nor as a
rich man, who bestows help upon those who come to him;
nor as one of those who confessedly are deserving of censure;
but as a teacher of the doctrine regarding the God of
all things, and of the worship which belongs to Him, and
of all moral precepts which are able to secure the favour of
the Supreme God to him who orders his life in conformity
therewith. Now, to Themistocles, or to any other man of
distinction, nothing happened to prove a hindrance to their
reputation; whereas to this man, besides what we have
already enumerated, and which are enough to cover with
dishonour the soul of a man even of the most noble nature,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>there was that apparently infamous death of crucifixion, which
was enough to efface his previously acquired glory, and to
lead those who, as they who disavow his doctrine assert, were
formerly deluded by him to abandon their delusion, and to
pass condemnation upon their deceiver.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Chapter <abbr title='thirty-one'>XXXI.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>And besides this, one may well wonder how it happened
that the disciples—if, as the calumniators of Jesus say, they
did not see him after his resurrection from the dead, and
were not persuaded of his divinity—were not afraid to endure
the same sufferings with their master, and to expose themselves
to danger, and to leave their native country to teach,
according to the desire of Jesus, the doctrine delivered to
them by him. For I think that no one who candidly
examines the facts would say that these men devoted themselves
to a life of danger for the sake of the doctrine of
Jesus, without a profound belief which he had wrought in
their minds of its truth, not only teaching them to conform
to his precepts, but others also, and to conform, moreover,
when manifest destruction to life impended over him who
ventured to introduce these new opinions into all places
and before all audiences, and who could retain as his friend
no human being who adhered to the former opinions and
usages. For did not the disciples of Jesus see, when they
ventured to prove not only to the Jews from their prophetic
Scriptures that this is he who was spoken of by the prophets,
but also to the other heathen nations, that he who was
crucified yesterday or the day before underwent this death
voluntarily on behalf of the human race,—that this was
analogous to the case of those who have died for their
country in order to remove pestilence, or barrenness, or
tempests? For it is probable that there is in the nature
of things, for certain mysterious reasons which are difficult
to be understood by the multitude, such a virtue that one
just man, dying a voluntary death for the common good,
might be the means of removing wicked spirits, which are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>the cause of plagues, or barrenness, or tempests, or similar
calamities. Let those, therefore, who would disbelieve the
statement that Jesus died on the cross on behalf of men, say
whether they also refuse to accept the many accounts current
both among Greeks and Barbarians, of persons who
have laid down their lives for the public advantage, in order
to remove those evils which had fallen upon cities and
countries? Or will they say that such events actually
happened, but that no credit is to be attached to that account
which makes this so-called man to have died to ensure
the destruction of a mighty evil spirit, the ruler of evil
spirits, who had held in subjection the souls of all men upon
earth? And the disciples of Jesus, seeing this and much
more (which, it is probable, they learned from Jesus in
private), and being filled, moreover, with a divine power
(since it was no mere poetical virgin that endowed them with
strength and courage, but the true wisdom and understanding
of God), exerted all their efforts “to become distinguished
among all men,” not only among the Argives, but among
all the Greeks and Barbarians alike, and “so bear away for
themselves a glorious renown.”<a id='r1172'></a><a href='#f1172' class='c007'><sup>[1172]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='thirty-two'>XXXII.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>But let us now return to where the Jew is introduced,
speaking of the mother of Jesus, and saying that “when she
was pregnant she was turned out of doors by the carpenter
to whom she had been betrothed, as having been guilty of
adultery, and that she bore a child to a certain soldier
named Panthera;” and let us see whether those who have
blindly concocted these fables about the adultery of the virgin
with Panthera, and her rejection by the carpenter, did not
invent these stories to overturn His miraculous conception by
the Holy Ghost: for they could have falsified the history in
a different manner, on account of its extremely miraculous
character, and not have admitted, as it were against their
will, that Jesus was born of no ordinary human marriage.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>It was to be expected, indeed, that those who would not
believe the miraculous birth of Jesus would invent some
falsehood. And their not doing this in a credible manner,
but [their] preserving the fact that it was not by Joseph
that the Virgin conceived Jesus, rendered the falsehood very
palpable to those who can understand and detect such inventions.
Is it at all agreeable to reason, that he who dared to
do so much for the human race, in order that, as far as in
him lay, all the Greeks and Barbarians, who were looking
for divine condemnation, might depart from evil, and regulate
their entire conduct in a manner pleasing to the Creator
of the world, should not have had a miraculous birth, but
one the vilest and most disgraceful of all? And I will ask
of them as Greeks, and particularly of Celsus, who either
holds or not the sentiments of Plato, and at any rate quotes
them, whether He who sends souls down into the bodies of
men, degraded Him who was to dare such mighty acts, and
to teach so many men, and to reform so many from the mass
of wickedness in the world, to a birth more disgraceful than
any other, and did not rather introduce Him into the world
through a lawful marriage? Or is it not more in conformity
with reason, that every soul, for certain mysterious reasons
(I speak now according to the opinion of Pythagoras, and
Plato, and Empedocles, whom Celsus frequently names), is
introduced into a body, and introduced according to its
deserts and former actions? It is probable, therefore, that
this soul also which conferred more benefit by its residence in
the flesh than that of many men (to avoid prejudice, I do not
say “all”), stood in need of a body not only superior to
others, but invested with all excellent qualities.</p>
<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='thirty-three'>XXXIII.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>Now if a particular soul, for certain mysterious reasons,
is not deserving of being placed in the body of a wholly
irrational being, nor yet in that of one purely rational, but
is clothed with a monstrous body, so that reason cannot
discharge its functions in one so fashioned, which has the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>head disproportioned to the other parts, and altogether too
short; and another receives such a body that the soul is a
little more rational than the other; and another still more so,
the nature of the body counteracting to a greater or less
degree the reception of the reasoning principle; why should
there not be also some soul which receives an altogether
miraculous body, possessing some qualities common to those
of other men, so that it may be able to pass through life
with them, but possessing also some quality of superiority,
so that the soul may be able to remain untainted by sin?
And if there be any truth in the doctrine of the physiognomists,
whether Zopyrus, or Loxus, or Polemon, or any other
who wrote on such a subject, and who profess to know in
some wonderful way that all bodies are adapted to the habits
of the souls, must there have been for that soul which was
to dwell with miraculous power among men, and work
mighty deeds, a body produced, as Celsus thinks, by an act
of adultery between Panthera and the Virgin?! Why, from
such unhallowed intercourse there must rather have been
brought forth some fool to do injury to mankind,—a teacher
of licentiousness and wickedness, and other evils; and not of
temperance, and righteousness, and the other virtues.</p>
<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='thirty-four'>XXXIV.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>But it was, as the prophets also predicted, from a virgin
that there was to be born, according to the promised sign,
one who was to give His name to the fact, showing that at
His birth God was to be with man. Now it seems to me
appropriate to the character of a Jew to have quoted the
prophecy of Isaiah, which says that Emmanuel was to be born
of a virgin. This, however, Celsus, who professes to know
everything, has not done, either from ignorance or from an
unwillingness (if he had read it and voluntarily passed it by
in silence) to furnish an argument which might defeat his
purpose. And the prediction runs thus: “And the Lord
spake again unto Ahaz, saying, Ask thee a sign of the Lord
thy God; ask it either in the depth or in the height above.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the Lord.
And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; is it a small
thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also?
Therefore the Lord Himself shall give you a sign. Behold,
a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call His
name Immanuel, which is, being interpreted, God with us.”<a id='r1173'></a><a href='#f1173' class='c007'><sup>[1173]</sup></a>
And that it was from intentional malice that Celsus did not
quote this prophecy, is clear to me from this, that although
he makes numerous quotations from the Gospel according to
Matthew, as of the star that appeared at the birth of Christ,
and other miraculous occurrences, he has made no mention
at all of this. Now, if a Jew should split words, and say that
the words are not, “Lo, a virgin,” but, “Lo, a young woman,”<a id='r1174'></a><a href='#f1174' class='c007'><sup>[1174]</sup></a>
we reply that the word “Olmah”—which the Septuagint have
rendered by “a virgin,” and others by “a young woman”—occurs,
as they say, in Deuteronomy, as applied to a “virgin,”
in the following connection: “If a damsel that is a virgin
be betrothed unto an husband, and a man find her in the
city, and lie with her; then ye shall bring them both out
unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with
stones that they die; the damsel,<a id='r1175'></a><a href='#f1175' class='c007'><sup>[1175]</sup></a> because she cried not, being
in the city; and the man, because he humbled his neighbour’s
wife.”<a id='r1176'></a><a href='#f1176' class='c007'><sup>[1176]</sup></a> And again: “But if a man find a betrothed damsel
in a field, and the man force her, and lie with her: then the
man only that lay with her shall die: but unto the damsel<a id='r1177'></a><a href='#f1177' class='c007'><sup>[1177]</sup></a>
ye shall do nothing; there is in her no sin worthy of death.”</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='thirty-five'>XXXV.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>But that we may not seem, because of a Hebrew word, to
endeavour to persuade those who are unable to determine
whether they ought to believe it or not, that the prophet
spoke of this man being born of a virgin, because at his birth
these words, “God with us,” were uttered, let us make good
our point from the words themselves. The Lord is related
to have spoken to Ahaz thus: “Ask a sign for thyself from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>the Lord thy God, either in the depth or height above;”<a id='r1178'></a><a href='#f1178' class='c007'><sup>[1178]</sup></a>
and afterwards the sign is given, “Behold, a virgin shall
conceive, and bear a son.”<a id='r1179'></a><a href='#f1179' class='c007'><sup>[1179]</sup></a> What kind of sign, then, would
that have been—a young woman who was not a virgin giving
birth to a child? And which of the two is the more appropriate
as the mother of Immanuel (<i>i.e.</i> “God with us”),—whether
a woman who has had intercourse with a man, and
who has conceived after the manner of women, or one who
is still a pure and holy virgin? Surely it is appropriate only
to the latter to produce a being at whose birth it is said, “God
with us.” And should he be so captious as to say that it is
to Ahaz that the command is addressed, “Ask for thyself a
sign from the Lord thy God,” we shall ask in return, who in
the times of Ahaz bore a son at whose birth the expression
is made use of, “Immanuel,” <i>i.e.</i> “God with us?” And if
no one can be found, then manifestly what was said to Ahaz
was said to the house of David, because it is written that
the Saviour was born of the house of David according to
the flesh; and this sign is said to be “in the depth or in
the height,” since “He that descended is the same also that
ascended up far above all heavens, that He might fill all
things.”<a id='r1180'></a><a href='#f1180' class='c007'><sup>[1180]</sup></a> And these arguments I employ as against a Jew
who believes in prophecy. Let Celsus now tell me, or any
of those who think with him, with what meaning the prophet
utters either these statements about the future, or the others
which are contained in the prophecies? Is it with any foresight
of the future or not? If with a foresight of the future, then
the prophets were divinely inspired; if with no foresight of
the future, let him explain the meaning of one who speaks
thus boldly regarding the future, and who is an object of
admiration among the Jews because of his prophetic powers.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='thirty-six'>XXXVI.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>And now, since we have touched upon the subject of the
prophets, what we are about to advance will be useful not
only to the Jews, who believe that they spake by divine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>inspiration, but also to the more candid among the Greeks.
To these we say that we must necessarily admit that the
Jews had prophets, if they were to be kept together under
that system of law which had been given them, and were
to believe in the Creator of the world, as they had learned,
and to be without pretexts, so far as the law was concerned,
for apostatizing to the polytheism of the heathen. And we
establish this necessity in the following manner. “For the
nations,” as it is written in the law of the Jews itself, “shall
hearken unto observers of times, and diviners;”<a id='r1181'></a><a href='#f1181' class='c007'><sup>[1181]</sup></a> but to that
people it is said: “But as for thee, the Lord thy God hath
not suffered thee so to do.”<a id='r1182'></a><a href='#f1182' class='c007'><sup>[1182]</sup></a> And to this is subjoined the
promise: “A prophet shall the Lord thy God raise up unto
thee from among thy brethren.”<a id='r1183'></a><a href='#f1183' class='c007'><sup>[1183]</sup></a> Since, therefore, the
heathen employ modes of divination either by oracles or by
omens, or by birds, or by ventriloquists, or by those who
profess the art of sacrifice, or by Chaldean genealogists—all
which practices were forbidden to the Jews—this people, if
they had no means of attaining a knowledge of futurity,
being led by the passion common to humanity of ascertaining
the future, would have despised their own prophets, as not
having in them any particle of divinity; and would not have
accepted any prophet after Moses, nor committed their words
to writing, but would have spontaneously betaken themselves
to the divining usages of the heathen, or attempted to establish
some such practices amongst themselves. There is therefore
no absurdity in their prophets having uttered predictions
even about events of no importance, to soothe those who
desire such things, as when Samuel prophesies regarding three
she-asses which were lost,<a id='r1184'></a><a href='#f1184' class='c007'><sup>[1184]</sup></a> or when mention is made in the
third book of Kings respecting the sickness of a king’s son.<a id='r1185'></a><a href='#f1185' class='c007'><sup>[1185]</sup></a>
And why should not those who desired to obtain auguries
from idols be severely rebuked by the administrators of the
law among the Jews?—as Elijah is found rebuking Ahaziah,
and saying, “Is it because there is not a God in Israel that
ye go to inquire of Baalzebub, god of Ekron?<a id='r1186'></a><a href='#f1186' class='c007'><sup>[1186]</sup></a>”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>
  <h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='thirty-seven'>XXXVII.</abbr></h4>
</div>
<p class='c005'>I think, then, that it has been pretty well established not
only that our Saviour was to be born of a virgin, but also
that there were prophets among the Jews who uttered not
merely general predictions about the future,—as <i>e.g.</i> regarding
Christ and the kingdoms of the world, and the events
that were to happen to Israel, and those nations which were
to believe on the Saviour, and many other things concerning
Him,—but also prophecies respecting particular events; as,
for instance, how the asses of Kish, which were lost, were to be
discovered, and regarding the sickness which had fallen upon
the son of the king of Israel, and any other recorded circumstance
of a similar kind. But as a further answer to the
Greeks, who do not believe in the birth of Jesus from a
virgin, we have to say that the Creator has shown, by the
generation of several kinds of animals, that what He has done
in the instance of one animal, He could do, if it pleased
Him, in that of others, and also of man himself. For it is
ascertained that there is a certain female animal which has
no intercourse with the male (as writers on animals say is
the case with vultures), and that this animal, without sexual
intercourse, preserves the succession of race. What incredibility,
therefore, is there in supposing that, if God wished to
send a divine teacher to the human race, He caused Him to
be born in some manner different from the common?<a id='r1187'></a><a href='#f1187' class='c007'><sup>[1187]</sup></a> Nay,
according to the Greeks themselves, all men were not born of
a man and woman. For if the world has been created, as
many even of the Greeks are pleased to admit, then the first
men must have been produced not from sexual intercourse,
but from the earth, in which spermatic elements existed;
which, however, I consider more incredible than that Jesus
was born like other men, so far as regards the half of his
birth. And there is no absurdity in employing Grecian
histories to answer Greeks, with the view of showing that we
are not the only persons who have recourse to miraculous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>narratives of this kind. For some have thought fit, not in
regard to ancient and heroic narratives, but in regard to
events of very recent occurrence, to relate as a possible thing
that Plato was the son of Amphictione, Ariston being prevented
from having marital intercourse with his wife until
she had given birth to him with whom she was pregnant by
Apollo. And yet these are veritable fables, which have led
to the invention of such stories concerning a man whom they
regarded as possessing greater wisdom and power than the
multitude, and as having received the beginning of his corporeal
substance from better and diviner elements than others,
because they thought that this was appropriate to persons
who were too great to be human beings. And since Celsus
has introduced the Jew disputing with Jesus, and tearing in
pieces, as he imagines, the fiction of His birth from a virgin,
comparing the Greek fables about Danae, and Melanippe,
and Auge, and Antiope, our answer is, that such language becomes
a buffoon, and not one who is writing in a serious tone.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='thirty-eight'>XXXVIII.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>But, moreover, taking the history, contained in the Gospel
according to Matthew, of our Lord’s descent into Egypt, he
refuses to believe the miraculous circumstances attending it,
viz. either that the angel gave the divine intimation, or that
our Lord’s quitting Judea and residing in Egypt was an
event of any significance; but he invents something altogether
different, admitting somehow the miraculous works done by
Jesus, by means of which He induced the multitude to follow
Him as the Christ. And yet he desires to throw discredit on
them, as being done by help of magic and not by divine power;
for he asserts “that he (Jesus), having been brought up as
an illegitimate child, and having served for hire in Egypt, and
then coming to the knowledge of certain miraculous powers,
returned from thence to his own country, and by means of
those powers proclaimed himself a God.” Now I do not
understand how a magician should exert himself to teach a
doctrine which persuades us always to act as if God were to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>judge every man for his deeds; and should have trained his
disciples, whom he was to employ as the ministers of his
doctrine, in the same belief. For did the latter make an
impression upon their hearers, after they had been so taught
to work miracles; or was it without the aid of these? The
assertion, therefore, that they did no miracles at all, but that,
after yielding their belief to arguments which were not at
all convincing, like the wisdom of Grecian dialectics,<a id='r1188'></a><a href='#f1188' class='c007'><sup>[1188]</sup></a> they
gave themselves up to the task of teaching the new doctrine
to those persons among whom they happened to take up their
abode, is altogether absurd. For in what did they place their
confidence when they taught the doctrine and disseminated
the new opinions? But if they indeed wrought miracles,
then how can it be believed that magicians exposed themselves
to such hazards to introduce a doctrine which forbade
the practice of magic?</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='thirty-nine'>XXXIX.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>I do not think it necessary to grapple with an argument
advanced not in a serious but in a scoffing spirit, such as the
following: “If the mother of Jesus was beautiful, then the
God whose nature is not to love a corruptible body, had intercourse
with her because she was beautiful;” or, “It was
improbable that the God would entertain a passion for her,
because she was neither rich nor of royal rank, seeing no one,
even of her neighbours, knew her.” And it is in the same
scoffing spirit that he adds: “When hated by her husband,
and turned out of doors, she was not saved by divine power,
nor was her story believed. Such things, he says, have no
connection with the kingdom of heaven.” In what respect
does such language differ from that of those who pour abuse
on others on the public streets, and whose words are unworthy
of any serious attention?</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>
  <h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='forty'>XL.</abbr></h4>
</div>
<p class='c005'>After these assertions, he takes from the Gospel of Matthew,
and perhaps also from the other Gospels, the account of
the dove alighting upon our Saviour at His baptism by
John, and desires to throw discredit upon the statement,
alleging that the narrative is a fiction. Having completely
disposed, as he imagined, of the story of our Lord’s birth
from a virgin, he does not proceed to deal in an orderly
manner with the accounts that follow it; since passion and
hatred observe no order, but angry and vindictive men
slander those whom they hate, as the feeling comes upon
them, being prevented by their passion from arranging their
accusations on a careful and orderly plan. For if he had
observed a proper arrangement, he would have taken up the
Gospel, and, with the view of assailing it, would have objected
to the first narrative, then passed on to the second, and so
on to the others. But now, after the birth from a virgin,
this Celsus, who professes to be acquainted with all our
history, attacks the account of the appearance of the Holy
Spirit in the form of a dove at the baptism. He then, after
that, tries to throw discredit upon the prediction that our
Lord was to come into the world. In the next place, he
runs away to what immediately follows the narrative of the
birth of Jesus—the account of the star, and of the wise men
who came from the east to worship the child. And you
yourself may find, if you take the trouble, many confused
statements made by Celsus throughout his whole book; so
that even in this account he may, by those who know how
to observe and require an orderly method of arrangement,
be convicted of great rashness and boasting, in having inscribed
upon his work the title of <i>A True Discourse</i>,—a thing
which is never done by a learned philosopher. For Plato
says, that it is not an indication of an intelligent man to
make strong assertions respecting those matters which are
somewhat uncertain; and the celebrated Chrysippus even,
who frequently states the reasons by which he is decided,
refers us to those whom we shall find to be abler speakers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>than himself. This man, however, who is wiser than those
already named, and than all the other Greeks, agreeably to
his assertion of being acquainted with everything, inscribed
upon his book the words, <i>A True Discourse</i>!</p>
<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='forty-one'>XLI.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>But, that we may not have the appearance of intentionally
passing by his charges through inability to refute them, we
have resolved to answer each one of them separately according
to our ability, attending not to the connection and
sequence of the nature of the things themselves, but to the
arrangement of the subjects as they occur in his book. Let
us therefore notice what he has to say by way of impugning
the bodily appearance of the Holy Spirit to our Saviour in the
form of a dove. And it is a Jew who addresses the following
language to Him whom we acknowledge to be our Lord
Jesus: “When you were bathing,” says the Jew, “beside
John, you say that what had the appearance of a bird from
the air alighted upon you.” And then this same Jew of his,
continuing his interrogations, asks, “What credible witness
beheld this appearance? or who heard a voice from heaven
declaring you to be the Son of God? What proof is there
of it, save your own assertion, and the statement of another of
those individuals who have been punished along with you?”</p>
<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='forty-two'>XLII.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>Before we begin our reply, we have to remark that the
endeavour to show, with regard to almost any history, however
true, that it actually occurred, and to produce an intelligent
conception regarding it, is one of the most difficult
undertakings that can be attempted, and is in some instances
an impossibility. For suppose that some one were to assert that
there never had been any Trojan war, chiefly on account of
the impossible narrative interwoven therewith, about a certain
Achilles being the son of a sea-goddess Thetis and of a man
Peleus, or Sarpedon being the son of Zeus, or Ascalaphus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>and Ialmenus the sons of Ares, or Æneas that of Aphrodite,
how should we prove that such was the case, especially under
the weight of the fiction attached, I know not how, to the
universally prevalent opinion that there was really a war
in Ilium between Greeks and Trojans? And suppose, also,
that some one disbelieved the story of Œdipus and Jocasta,
and of their two sons Eteocles and Polynices, because the
sphinx, a kind of half-virgin, was introduced into the narrative,
how should we demonstrate the reality of such a thing?
And in like manner also with the history of the Epigoni,
although there is no such marvellous event interwoven with
it, or with the return of the Heracleidæ, or countless other
historical events. But he who deals candidly with histories,
and would wish to keep himself also from being imposed
upon by them, will exercise his judgment as to what statements
he will give his assent to, and what he will accept
figuratively, seeking to discover the meaning of the authors
of such inventions, and from what statements he will withhold
his belief, as having been written for the gratification of
certain individuals. And we have said this by way of anticipation
respecting the whole history related in the Gospels
concerning Jesus, not as inviting men of acuteness to a
simple and unreasoning faith, but wishing to show that there
is need of candour in those who are to read, and of much
investigation, and, so to speak, of insight into the meaning
of the writers, that the object with which each event has
been recorded may be discovered.</p>
<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='forty-three'>XLIII.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>We shall therefore say, in the first place, that if he who
disbelieves the appearance of the Holy Spirit in the form of
a dove had been described as an Epicurean, or a follower of
Democritus, or a Peripatetic, the statement would have been
in keeping with the character of such an objector. But now
even this Celsus, wisest of all men, did not perceive that it is
to a Jew, who believes more incredible things contained in
the writings of the prophets than the narrative of the appearance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>of the dove, that he attributes such an objection!
For one might say to the Jew, when expressing his disbelief
of the appearance, and thinking to assail it as a fiction, “How
are you able to prove, sir, that the Lord spake to Adam, or
to Eve, or to Cain, or to Noah, or to Abraham, or to Isaac,
or to Jacob, those words which He is recorded to have spoken
to these men?” And, to compare history with history, I would
say to the Jew, “Even your own Ezekiel writes, saying,
‘The heavens were opened, and I saw a vision of God.’<a id='r1189'></a><a href='#f1189' class='c007'><sup>[1189]</sup></a>
After relating which, he adds, ‘This was the appearance of
the likeness of the glory of the Lord; and He said to me,’”<a id='r1190'></a><a href='#f1190' class='c007'><sup>[1190]</sup></a> etc.
Now, if what is related of Jesus be false, since we cannot,
as you suppose, clearly prove it to be true, it being seen or
heard by himself alone, and, as you appear to have observed,
also by one of those who were punished, why should we not
rather say that Ezekiel also was dealing in the marvellous
when he said, “The heavens were opened,” etc.? Nay, even
Isaiah asserts, “I saw the Lord of hosts sitting on a throne,
high and lifted up; and the seraphim stood round about it:
the one had six wings, and the other had six wings.”<a id='r1191'></a><a href='#f1191' class='c007'><sup>[1191]</sup></a> How
can we tell whether he really saw them or not? Now, O
Jew, you have believed these visions to be true, and to have
been not only shown to the prophet by a diviner Spirit, but
also to have been both spoken and recorded by the same.
And who is the more worthy of belief, when declaring that
the heavens were opened before him, and that he heard a
voice, or beheld the Lord of Sabaoth sitting upon a throne
high and lifted up,—whether Isaiah and Ezekiel or Jesus?
Of the former, indeed, no work has been found equal to those
of the latter; whereas the good deeds of Jesus have not been
confined solely to the period of His tabernacling in the flesh,
but up to the present time His power still produces conversion
and amelioration of life in those who believe in God
through Him. And a manifest proof that these things are
done by His power, is the fact that, although, as He Himself
said, and as is admitted, there are not labourers enough to
gather in the harvest of souls, there really is nevertheless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>such a great harvest of those who are gathered together and
conveyed into the everywhere existing threshing-floors and
churches of God.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='forty-four'>XLIV.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>And with these arguments I answer the Jew, not disbelieving,
I who am a Christian, Ezekiel and Isaiah, but being
very desirous to show, on the footing of our common belief,
that this man is far more worthy of credit than they are
when He says that He beheld such a sight, and, as is probable,
related to His disciples the vision which He saw, and
told them of the voice which He heard. But another party
might object, that not all those who have narrated the appearance
of the dove and the voice from heaven heard the
accounts of these things from Jesus, but that that Spirit
which taught Moses the history of events before his own
time, beginning with the creation, and descending down to
Abraham his father, taught also the writers of the Gospel the
miraculous occurrence which took place at the time of Jesus’
baptism. And he who is adorned with the spiritual gift,<a id='r1192'></a><a href='#f1192' class='c007'><sup>[1192]</sup></a>
called the “word of wisdom,” will explain also the reason of
the heavens opening, and the dove appearing, and why the
Holy Spirit appeared to Jesus in the form of no other living
thing than that of a dove. But our present subject does not
require us to explain this, our purpose being to show that
Celsus displayed no sound judgment in representing a Jew
as disbelieving, on such grounds, a fact which has greater
probability in its favour than many events in which he
firmly reposes confidence.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='forty-five'>XLV.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>And I remember on one occasion, at a disputation held
with certain Jews who were reputed learned men, having
employed the following argument in the presence of many
judges: “Tell me, sirs,” I said, “since there are two individuals
<span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>who have visited the human race, regarding whom are
related marvellous works surpassing human power—Moses,
viz., your own legislator, who wrote about himself, and Jesus
our teacher, who has left no writings regarding Himself, but
to whom testimony is borne by the disciples in the Gospels—what
are the grounds for deciding that Moses is to be believed
as speaking the truth, although the Egyptians slander him as
a sorcerer, and as appearing to have wrought his mighty
works by jugglery, while Jesus is not to be believed because
you are His accusers? And yet there are nations which
bear testimony in favour of both: the Jews to Moses; and
the Christians, who do not deny the prophetic mission of
Moses, but proving from that very source the truth of the
statement regarding Jesus, accept as true the miraculous
circumstances related of Him by His disciples. Now, if ye
ask us for the reasons of our faith in Jesus, give yours first
for believing in Moses, who lived before Him, and then we
shall give you ours for accepting the latter. But if you draw
back, and shirk a demonstration, then we, following your own
example, decline for the present to offer any demonstration
likewise. Nevertheless, admit that ye have no proof to offer
for Moses, and then listen to our defence of Jesus derived
from the law and the prophets. And now observe what is
almost incredible! It is shown from the declarations concerning
Jesus, contained in the law and the prophets, that
both Moses and the prophets were truly prophets of God.”</p>
<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='forty-six'>XLVI.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>For the law and the prophets are full of marvels similar
to those recorded of Jesus at His baptism, viz. regarding
the dove and the voice from heaven. And I think the
wonders wrought by Jesus are a proof of the Holy Spirit’s
having then appeared in the form of a dove, although Celsus,
from a desire to cast discredit upon them, alleges that He
performed only what He had learned among the Egyptians.
And I shall refer not only to His miracles, but, as is proper,
to those also of the apostles of Jesus. For they could not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>without the help of miracles and wonders have prevailed
on those who heard their new doctrines and new teachings
to abandon their national usages, and to accept their instructions
at the danger to themselves even of death. And
there are still preserved among Christians traces of that
Holy Spirit which appeared in the form of a dove. They
expel evil spirits, and perform many cures, and foresee
certain events, according to the will of the Logos. And
although Celsus, or the Jew whom he has introduced, may
treat with mockery what I am going to say, I shall say it
nevertheless,—that many have been converted to Christianity
as if against their will, some sort of spirit having suddenly
transformed their minds from a hatred of the doctrine to a
readiness to die in its defence, and having appeared to them
either in a waking vision or a dream of the night. Many
such instances have we known, which, if we were to commit
to writing, although they were seen and witnessed by ourselves,
we should afford great occasion for ridicule to unbelievers,
who would imagine that we, like those whom they
suppose to have invented such things, had ourselves also done
the same. But God is witness of our conscientious desire,
not by false statements, but by testimonies of different kinds,
to establish the divinity of the doctrine of Jesus. And as it
is a Jew who is perplexed about the account of the Holy
Spirit having descended upon Jesus in the form of a dove, we
would say to him, “Sir, who is it that says in Isaiah, ‘And
now the Lord hath sent me and His Spirit?’”<a id='r1193'></a><a href='#f1193' class='c007'><sup>[1193]</sup></a> In which
sentence, as the meaning is doubtful—viz. whether the
Father and the Holy Spirit sent Jesus, or the Father sent
both Christ and the Holy Spirit—the latter is correct. For,
because the Saviour was sent, afterwards the Holy Spirit
was sent also, that the prediction of the prophet might be
fulfilled; and as it was necessary that the fulfilment of the
prophecy should be known to posterity, the disciples of Jesus
for that reason committed the result to writing.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>
  <h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='forty-seven'>XLVII.</abbr></h4>
</div>
<p class='c005'>I would like to say to Celsus, who represents the Jew as
accepting somehow John as a Baptist, who baptized Jesus,
that the existence of John the Baptist, baptizing for the remission
of sins, is related by one who lived no great length
of time after John and Jesus. For in the 18th book of his
<i>Antiquities of the Jews</i>, Josephus bears witness to John as
having been a Baptist, and as promising purification to those
who underwent the rite.<a id='r1194'></a><a href='#f1194' class='c007'><sup>[1194]</sup></a> Now this writer, although not
believing in Jesus as the Christ, in seeking after the cause
of the fall of Jerusalem and the destruction of the temple,
whereas he ought to have said that the conspiracy against
Jesus was the cause of these calamities befalling the people,
since they put to death Christ, who was a prophet, says
nevertheless—being, although against his will, not far from
the truth—that these disasters happened to the Jews as a
punishment for the death of James the Just, who was a
brother of Jesus (called Christ),—the Jews having put him
to death, although he was a man most distinguished for his
justice. Paul, a genuine disciple of Jesus, says that he
regarded this James as a brother of the Lord, not so much
on account of their relationship by blood, or of their being
brought up together, as because of his virtue and doctrine.<a id='r1195'></a><a href='#f1195' class='c007'><sup>[1195]</sup></a>
If, then, he says that it was on account of James that the
desolation of Jerusalem was made to overtake the Jews, how
should it not be more in accordance with reason to say that it
happened on account [of the death] of Jesus Christ, of whose
divinity so many churches are witnesses, composed of those
who have been converted from a flood of sins, and who have
joined themselves to the Creator, and who refer all their
actions to His good pleasure?</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='forty-eight'>XLVIII.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>Although the Jew, then, may offer no defence for himself
in the instances of Ezekiel and Isaiah, when we compare
<span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>the opening of the heavens to Jesus, and the voice that
was heard by Him, to the similar cases which we find recorded
in Ezekiel and Isaiah, or any other of the prophets,
we nevertheless, so far as we can, shall support our position,
maintaining that, as it is a matter of belief that in a <i>dream</i>
impressions have been brought before the minds of many,
some relating to divine things, and others to future events of
this life, and this either with clearness or in an enigmatic
manner,—a fact which is manifest to all who accept the
doctrine of providence; so how is it absurd to say that the
mind which could receive impressions in a <i>dream</i> should be
impressed also in a waking vision, for the benefit either of
him on whom the impressions are made, or of those who are
to hear the account of them from him? And as in a dream
we fancy that we hear, and that the organs of hearing are
actually impressed, and that we see with our eyes—although
neither the bodily organs of sight nor hearing are affected,
but it is the mind alone which has these sensations—so there
is no absurdity in believing that similar things occurred to
the prophets, when it is recorded that they witnessed occurrences
of a rather wonderful kind, as when they either heard
the words of the Lord or beheld the heavens opened. For
I do not suppose that the visible heaven was actually opened,
and its physical structure divided, in order that Ezekiel
might be able to record such an occurrence. Should not,
therefore, the same be believed of the Saviour by every
intelligent hearer of the Gospels?—although such an occurrence
may be a stumbling-block to the simple, who in their
simplicity would set the whole world in movement, and
split in sunder the compact and mighty body of the whole
heavens. But he who examines such matters more profoundly
will say, that there being, as the Scripture calls it, a
kind of general divine perception which the blessed man alone
knows how to discover, according to the saying of Solomon,
“Thou shalt find the knowledge of God;”<a id='r1196'></a><a href='#f1196' class='c007'><sup>[1196]</sup></a> and as there
are various forms of this perceptive power, such as a faculty
of vision which can naturally see things that are better than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>bodies, among which are ranked the cherubim and seraphim;
and a faculty of hearing which can perceive voices which
have not their being in the air; and a sense of taste which
can make use of living bread that has come down from
heaven, and that giveth life unto the world; and so also a
sense of smelling, which scents such things as leads Paul to
say that he is a sweet savour of Christ unto God;<a id='r1197'></a><a href='#f1197' class='c007'><sup>[1197]</sup></a> and a
sense of touch, by which John says that he “handled with his
hands of the Word of life;”<a id='r1198'></a><a href='#f1198' class='c007'><sup>[1198]</sup></a>—the blessed prophets having
discovered this divine perception, and seeing and hearing in
this divine manner, and tasting likewise, and smelling, so
to speak, with no sensible organs of perception, and laying
hold on the Logos by faith, so that a healing effluence from
it comes upon them, saw in this manner what they record as
having seen, and heard what they say they heard, and were
affected in a similar manner to what they describe when
eating the roll of a book that was given them.<a id='r1199'></a><a href='#f1199' class='c007'><sup>[1199]</sup></a> And so also
Isaac smelled the savour of his son’s divine garments,<a id='r1200'></a><a href='#f1200' class='c007'><sup>[1200]</sup></a> and
added to the spiritual blessing these words: “See, the savour
of my son is as the savour of a full field which the Lord
blessed.”<a id='r1201'></a><a href='#f1201' class='c007'><sup>[1201]</sup></a> And similarly to this, and more as a matter to be
understood by the mind than to be perceived by the senses,
Jesus touched the leper,<a id='r1202'></a><a href='#f1202' class='c007'><sup>[1202]</sup></a> to cleanse him, as I think, in a two-fold
sense,—freeing him not only, as the multitude heard,
from the visible leprosy by visible contact, but also from that
other leprosy, by His truly divine touch. It is in this way,
accordingly, that John testifies when he says, “I beheld the
Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon
Him. And I knew Him not; but He that sent me to baptize
with water, the same said to me, Upon whom you will see
the Spirit descending, and abiding on Him, the same is He
that baptizeth with the Holy Ghost. And I saw, and bear
witness, that this is the Son of God.”<a id='r1203'></a><a href='#f1203' class='c007'><sup>[1203]</sup></a> Now it was to Jesus
that the heavens were opened; and on that occasion no one
except John is recorded to have seen them opened. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>with respect to this opening of the heavens, the Saviour,
foretelling to His disciples that it would happen, and that
they would see it, says, “Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye
shall see the heavens opened, and the angels of God ascending
and descending upon the Son of man.”<a id='r1204'></a><a href='#f1204' class='c007'><sup>[1204]</sup></a> And so Paul
was carried away into the third heaven, having previously seen
it opened, since he was a disciple of Jesus. It does not, however,
belong to our present object to explain why Paul says,
“Whether in the body, I know not; or whether out of the
body, I know not: God knoweth.”<a id='r1205'></a><a href='#f1205' class='c007'><sup>[1205]</sup></a> But I shall add to my
argument even those very points which Celsus imagines, viz.
that Jesus Himself related the account of the opening of the
heavens, and the descent of the Holy Spirit upon Him at the
Jordan in the form of a dove, although the Scripture does
not assert that He said that He saw it. For this great man
did not perceive that it was not in keeping with Him who
commanded His disciples on the occasion of the vision on the
mount, “Tell what ye have seen to no man, until the Son of
man be risen from the dead,”<a id='r1206'></a><a href='#f1206' class='c007'><sup>[1206]</sup></a> to have related to His disciples
what was seen and heard by John at the Jordan. For
it may be observed as a trait of the character of Jesus, that
He on all occasions avoided unnecessary talk about Himself;
and on that account said, “If I speak of myself, my
witness is not true.”<a id='r1207'></a><a href='#f1207' class='c007'><sup>[1207]</sup></a> And since He avoided unnecessary
talk about Himself, and preferred to show by acts rather
than words that He was the Christ, the Jews for that
reason said to Him, “If thou art the Christ, tell us plainly.”<a id='r1208'></a><a href='#f1208' class='c007'><sup>[1208]</sup></a>
And as it is a Jew who, in the work of Celsus, uses the language
to Jesus regarding the appearance of the Holy Spirit
in the form of a dove, “This is your own testimony, unsupported
save by one of those who were sharers of your punishment,
whom you adduce,” it is necessary for us to show him
that such a statement is not appropriately placed in the
mouth of a Jew. For the Jews do not connect John with
Jesus, nor the punishment of John with that of Christ. And
by this instance, this man who boasts of universal knowledge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>is convicted of not knowing what words he ought to ascribe to
a Jew engaged in a disputation with Jesus.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='forty-nine'>XLIX.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>After this he wilfully sets aside, I know not why, the
strongest evidence in confirmation of the claims of Jesus, viz.
that His coming was predicted by the Jewish prophets—Moses,
and those who succeeded as well as preceded that legislator—from
inability, as I think, to meet the argument that neither
the Jews nor any other heretical sect refuse to believe that
Christ was the subject of prophecy. But perhaps he was
unacquainted with the prophecies relating to Christ. For no
one who was acquainted with the statements of the Christians,
that many prophets foretold the advent of the Saviour, would
have ascribed to a Jew sentiments which it would have better
befitted a Samaritan or a Sadducee to utter; nor would the
Jew in the dialogue have expressed himself in language like
the following: “But my prophet once declared in Jerusalem,
that the Son of God will come as the Judge of the righteous
and the Punisher of the wicked.” Now it is not one of the
prophets merely who predicted the advent of Christ. But
although the Samaritans and Sadducees, who receive the
books of Moses alone, would say that there were contained
in them predictions regarding Christ, yet certainly not in
Jerusalem, which is not even mentioned in the times of
Moses, was the prophecy uttered. It were indeed to be
desired, that all the accusers of Christianity were equally
ignorant with Celsus, not only of the facts, but of the bare
letter of Scripture, and would so direct their assaults against
it, that their arguments might not have the least available
influence in shaking, I do not say the faith, but the little
faith of unstable and temporary believers. A Jew, however,
would not admit that any prophet used the expression, “The
‘Son of God’ will come;” for the term which they employ
is, “The ‘Christ of God’ will come.” And many a time
indeed do they directly interrogate us about the “Son of
God,” saying that no such being exists, or was made the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>subject of prophecy. We do not of course assert that the
“Son of God” is not the subject of prophecy; but we assert
that he most inappropriately attributes to the Jewish disputant,
who would not allow that He was, such language as,
“My prophet once declared in Jerusalem that the ‘Son of
God’ will come.”</p>
<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='fifty'>L.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>In the next place, as if the only event predicted were this,
that He was to be “the Judge of the righteous and the
Punisher of the wicked,” and as if neither the place of His
birth, nor the sufferings which He was to endure at the hands
of the Jews, nor His resurrection, nor the wonderful works
which He was to perform, had been made the subject of
prophecy, he continues: “Why should it be you alone, rather
than innumerable others, who existed after the prophecies
were published, to whom these predictions are applicable?”
And desiring, I know not how, to suggest to others the possibility
of the notion that they themselves were the persons
referred to by the prophets, he says that “some, carried away
by enthusiasm, and others having gathered a multitude of
followers, give out that the Son of God is come down from
heaven.” Now we have not ascertained that such occurrences
are admitted to have taken place among the Jews. We have
to remark then, in the first place, that many of the prophets
have uttered predictions in all kinds of ways<a id='r1209'></a><a href='#f1209' class='c007'><sup>[1209]</sup></a> regarding Christ;
some by means of dark sayings, others in allegories or in
some other manner, and some also in express words. And as
in what follows he says, in the character of the Jew addressing
the converts from his own nation, and repeating emphatically
and malevolently, that “the prophecies referred to the
events of his life may also suit other events as well,” we shall
state a few of them out of a greater number; and with respect
to these, any one who chooses may say what he thinks fitted
to ensure a refutation of them, and which may turn away
intelligent believers from the faith.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>
  <h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='fifty-one'>LI.</abbr></h4>
</div>
<p class='c005'>Now the Scripture speaks, respecting the place of the
Saviour’s birth—that the Ruler was to come forth from
Bethlehem—in the following manner: “And thou Bethlehem,
house of Ephrata, art not the least among the thousands of
Judah: for out of thee shall He come forth unto me who is
to be Ruler in Israel; and His goings forth have been of
old, from everlasting.”<a id='r1210'></a><a href='#f1210' class='c007'><sup>[1210]</sup></a> Now this prophecy could not suit any
one of those who, as Celsus’ Jew says, were fanatics and mob-leaders,
and who gave out that they had come from heaven,
unless it were clearly shown that He had been born in
Bethlehem, or, as another might say, had come forth from
Bethlehem to be the leader of the people. With respect to
the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem, if any one desires, after the
prophecy of Micah and after the history recorded in the
Gospels by the disciples of Jesus, to have additional evidence
from other sources, let him know that, in conformity with
the narrative in the Gospel regarding His birth, there is
shown at Bethlehem the cave where He was born, and the
manger in the cave where He was wrapped in swaddling-clothes.
And this sight is greatly talked of in surrounding
places, even among the enemies of the faith, it being said
that in this cave was born that Jesus who is worshipped and
reverenced by the Christians. Moreover, I am of opinion
that, before the advent of Christ, the chief priests and scribes
of the people, on account of the distinctness and clearness
of this prophecy, taught that in Bethlehem the Christ was
to be born. And this opinion had prevailed also extensively
among the Jews; for which reason it is related that Herod,
on inquiring at the chief priests and scribes of the people,
heard from them that the Christ was to be born in Bethlehem
of Judea, “whence David was.” It is stated also in the
Gospel according to John, that the Jews declared that the
Christ was to be born in Bethlehem, “whence David was.”<a id='r1211'></a><a href='#f1211' class='c007'><sup>[1211]</sup></a>
But after our Lord’s coming, those who busied themselves
with overthrowing the belief that the place of His birth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>had been the subject of prophecy from the beginning, withheld
such teaching from the people; acting in a similar
manner to those individuals who won over those soldiers of
the guard stationed around the tomb who had seen Him arise
from the dead, and who instructed these eye-witnesses to
report as follows: “Say that his disciples, while we slept,
came and stole him away. And if this come to the governor’s
ears, we shall persuade him, and secure you.”<a id='r1212'></a><a href='#f1212' class='c007'><sup>[1212]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='fifty-two'>LII.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>Strife and prejudice are powerful instruments in leading
men to disregard even those things which are abundantly
clear; so that they who have somehow become familiar with
certain opinions, which have deeply imbued their minds, and
stamped them with a certain character, will not give them
up. For a man will abandon his habits in respect to other
things, although it may be difficult for him to tear himself
from them, more easily than he will surrender his opinions.
Nay, even the former are not easily put aside by those who
have become accustomed to them; and so neither houses, nor
cities, nor villages, nor intimate acquaintances, are willingly
forsaken when we are prejudiced in their favour. This,
therefore, was a reason why many of the Jews at that time
disregarded the clear testimony of the prophecies, and
miracles which Jesus wrought, and of the sufferings which
He is related to have endured. And that human nature is
thus affected, will be manifest to those who observe that
those who have once been prejudiced in favour of the most
contemptible and paltry traditions of their ancestors and
fellow-citizens, with difficulty lay them aside. For example,
no one could easily persuade an Egyptian to despise what he
had learned from his fathers, so as no longer to consider this
or that irrational animal as a god, or not to guard against
eating, even under the penalty of death, of the flesh of such
an animal. Now, if in carrying our examination of this
subject to a considerable length, we have enumerated the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>points respecting Bethlehem, and the prophecy regarding it,
we consider that we were obliged to do this, by way of defence
against those who would assert that if the prophecies
current among the Jews regarding Jesus were so clear as
we represent them, why did they not at His coming give in
their adhesion to His doctrine, and betake themselves to the
better life pointed out by Him? Let no one, however, bring
such a reproach against believers, since he may see that
reasons of no light weight are assigned by those who have
learned to state them, for their faith in Jesus.</p>
<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='fifty-three'>LIII.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>And if we should ask for a second prophecy, which may
appear to us to have a clear reference to Jesus, we would
quote that which was written by Moses very many years
before the advent of Christ, when he makes Jacob, on his
departure from this life, to have uttered predictions regarding
each of his sons, and to have said of Judah along with
the others: “The ruler will not fail from Judah, and the
governor from his loins, until that which is reserved for him
come.”<a id='r1213'></a><a href='#f1213' class='c007'><sup>[1213]</sup></a> Now, any one meeting with this prophecy, which
is in reality much older than Moses, so that one who was not
a believer might suspect that it was not written by him,
would be surprised that Moses should be able to predict that
the princes of the Jews, seeing there are among them twelve
tribes, should be born of the tribe of Judah, and should be
the rulers of the people; for which reason also the whole
nation are called Jews, deriving their name from the ruling
tribe. And, in the second place, one who candidly considers
the prophecy, would be surprised how, after declaring that the
rulers and governors of the people were to proceed from the
tribe of Judah, he should determine also the limit of their rule,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>saying that “the ruler should not fail from Judah, nor the
governor from his loins, until there should come that which
was reserved for him, and that He is the expectation of the
Gentiles.”<a id='r1214'></a><a href='#f1214' class='c007'><sup>[1214]</sup></a> For He came for whom these things were reserved,
viz. the Christ of God, the ruler of the promises of
God. And manifestly He is the only one among those who
preceded, and, I might make bold to say, among those also
who followed Him, who was the expectation of the Gentiles;
for converts from among all the Gentile nations have believed
on God through Him, and that in conformity with
the prediction of Isaiah, that in His name the Gentiles had
hoped: “In Thy name shall the Gentiles hope.”<a id='r1215'></a><a href='#f1215' class='c007'><sup>[1215]</sup></a> And this
man said also to those who are in prison, as every man is a
captive to the chains of his sins, “Come forth;” and to the
ignorant, “Come into the light:” these things also having
been thus foretold: “I have given Thee for a covenant of the
people, to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate
heritage; saying to the prisoners, Go forth; and to them
that are in darkness, Show yourselves.”<a id='r1216'></a><a href='#f1216' class='c007'><sup>[1216]</sup></a> And we may see
at the appearing of this man, by means of those who everywhere
throughout the world have reposed a simple faith in
Him, the fulfilment of this prediction: “They shall feed in
the ways, and their pastures shall be in all the beaten tracks.”<a id='r1217'></a><a href='#f1217' class='c007'><sup>[1217]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='fifty-four'>LIV.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>And since Celsus, although professing to know all about
the Gospel, reproaches the Saviour because of His sufferings,
saying that He received no assistance from the Father, or
was unable to aid Himself; we have to state that His sufferings
were the subject of prophecy, along with the cause of
them; because it was for the benefit of mankind that He
should die on their account,<a id='r1218'></a><a href='#f1218' class='c007'><sup>[1218]</sup></a> and should suffer stripes because
of His condemnation. It was predicted, moreover, that some
from among the Gentiles would come to the knowledge of
Him (among whom the prophets are not included); and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>it had been declared that He would be seen in a form
which is deemed dishonourable among men. The words of
prophecy run thus: “Lo, my Servant shall have understanding,
and shall be exalted and glorified, and raised exceedingly
high. In like manner, many shall be astonished
at Thee; so Thy form shall be in no reputation among men,
and Thy glory among the sons of men. Lo, many nations
shall marvel because of Him; and kings shall close their
mouths: because they, to whom no message about Him was
sent, shall see Him; and they who have not heard of Him,
shall have knowledge of Him.”<a id='r1219'></a><a href='#f1219' class='c007'><sup>[1219]</sup></a> “Lord, who hath believed
our report? and to whom was the arm of the Lord revealed?
We have reported, as a child before Him, as a root in a
thirsty ground. He has no form nor glory; and we beheld
Him, and He had not any form nor beauty: but His appearance
was without honour, and deficient more than that of all
men. He was a man under suffering, and who knew how to
bear sickness: because His countenance was averted, He was
treated with disrespect, and was made of no account. This
man bears our sins, and suffers pain on our behalf; and we regarded
Him as in trouble, and in suffering, and as ill-treated.
But He was wounded for our sins, and bruised for our iniquities.
The chastisement of our peace was upon Him; by
His stripes we were healed. We all, like sheep, wandered
from the way. A man wandered in his way, and the Lord
delivered Him on account of our sins; and He, because of His
evil treatment, opens not His mouth. As a sheep was He led
to slaughter; and as a lamb before her shearer is dumb, so
He opens not His mouth. In His humiliation His judgment
was taken away. And who shall describe His generation?
because His life is taken away from the earth; because of
the iniquities of my people was He led unto death.”<a id='r1220'></a><a href='#f1220' class='c007'><sup>[1220]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='fifty-five'>LV.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>Now I remember that, on one occasion, at a disputation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>held with certain Jews, who were reckoned wise men, I
quoted these prophecies; to which my Jewish opponent
replied, that these predictions bore reference to the whole
people, regarded as <i>one individual</i>, and as being in a state of
dispersion and suffering, in order that many proselytes might
be gained, on account of the dispersion of the Jews among
numerous heathen nations. And in this way he explained
the words, “Thy form shall be of no reputation among
men;” and then, “They to whom no message was sent
respecting him shall see;” and the expression, “A man
under suffering.” Many arguments were employed on that
occasion during the discussion to prove that these predictions
regarding one particular person were not rightly applied by
them to the whole nation. And I asked to what character
the expression would be appropriate, “This man bears our
sins, and suffers pain on our behalf;” and this, “But he was
wounded for our sins, and bruised for our iniquities;” and
to whom the expression properly belonged, “By his stripes
were we healed.” For it is manifest that it is they who had
been sinners, and had been healed by the Saviour’s sufferings
(whether belonging to the Jewish nation or converts from
the Gentiles), who use such language in the writings of the
prophet who foresaw these events, and who, under the influence
of the Holy Spirit, applied these words to a person.
But we seemed to press them hardest with the expression,
“Because of the iniquities of my people was he led away
unto death.” For if the people, according to them, are the
subject of the prophecy, how is the man said to be led away
to death because of the iniquities of the people of God, unless
he be a different person from that people of God? And
who is this person save Jesus Christ, by whose stripes they
who believe on Him are healed, when “He had spoiled the
principalities and powers (that were over us), and had made
a show of them openly on His cross?” At another time we
may explain the several parts of the prophecy, leaving none
of them unexamined. But these matters have been treated
at greater length, necessarily as I think, on account of the
language of the Jew, as quoted in the work of Celsus.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>
  <h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='fifty-six'>LVI.</abbr></h4>
</div>
<p class='c005'>Now it escaped the notice of Celsus, and of the Jew whom
he has introduced, and of all who are not believers in Jesus,
that the prophecies speak of two advents of Christ: the former
characterized by human suffering and humility, in order that
Christ, being with men, might make known the way that
leads to God, and might leave no man in this life a ground
of excuse, in saying that he knew not of the judgment to
come; and the latter, distinguished only by glory and divinity,
having no element of human infirmity intermingled with its
divine greatness. To quote the prophecies at length would
be tedious; and I deem it sufficient for the present to quote
a part of the forty-fifth Psalm, which has this inscription, in
addition to others, “A Psalm for the Beloved,” where God
is evidently addressed in these words: “Grace is poured into
Thy lips: therefore God will bless Thee for ever and ever.
Gird Thy sword on Thy thigh, O mighty One, with Thy beauty
and Thy majesty. And stretch forth, and ride prosperously,
and reign, because of Thy truth, and meekness, and righteousness;
and Thy right hand shall lead Thee marvellously. Thine
arrows are pointed, O mighty One; the people will fall under
Thee in the heart of the enemies of the King.”<a id='r1221'></a><a href='#f1221' class='c007'><sup>[1221]</sup></a> But attend
carefully to what follows, where He is called God: “For Thy
throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness
is the sceptre of Thy kingdom. Thou hast loved righteousness,
and hated iniquity: therefore God, even Thy God, hath
anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows.”<a id='r1222'></a><a href='#f1222' class='c007'><sup>[1222]</sup></a>
And observe that the prophet, speaking familiarly to God,
whose “throne is for ever and ever,” and “a sceptre of righteousness
the sceptre of His kingdom,” says that this God has
been anointed by a God who was His God, and anointed,
because more than His fellows He had loved righteousness
and hated iniquity. And I remember that I pressed the Jew,
who was deemed a learned man, very hard with this passage;
and he, being perplexed about it, gave such an answer as was
in keeping with his Judaistic views, saying that the words,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>“Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of
righteousness is the sceptre of Thy kingdom,” are spoken of
the God of all things; and these, “Thou hast loved righteousness
and hated iniquity, therefore Thy God hath anointed
Thee,” etc., refer to the Messiah.<a id='r1223'></a><a href='#f1223' class='c007'><sup>[1223]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='fifty-seven'>LVII.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>The Jew, moreover, in the treatise, addresses the Saviour
thus: “If you say that every man, born according to the
decree of Divine Providence, is a son of God, in what respect
should you differ from another?” In reply to whom we
say, that every man who, as Paul expresses it, is no longer
under fear, as a schoolmaster, but who chooses good for its
own sake, is “a son of God;” but this man is distinguished
far and wide above every man who is called, on account of
his virtues, a son of God, seeing He is, as it were, a kind of
source and beginning of all such. The words of Paul are as
follow: “For ye have not received the spirit of bondage
again to fear; but ye have received the spirit of adoption,
whereby we cry, Abba, Father.”<a id='r1224'></a><a href='#f1224' class='c007'><sup>[1224]</sup></a> But, according to the Jew
of Celsus, “countless individuals will convict Jesus of falsehood,
alleging that those predictions which were spoken of
him were intended of them.” We are not aware, indeed,
whether Celsus knew of any who, after coming into this
world, and having desired to act as Jesus did, declared themselves
to be also the “sons of God,” or the “power” of God.
But since it is in the spirit of truth that we examine each
passage, we shall mention that there was a certain Theudas
among the Jews before the birth of Christ, who gave himself
out as some great one, after whose death his deluded followers
were completely dispersed. And after him, in the days of
the census, when Jesus appears to have been born, one Judas,
a Galilean, gathered around him many of the Jewish people,
saying he was a wise man, and a teacher of certain new
doctrines. And when he also had paid the penalty of his
rebellion, his doctrine was overturned, having taken hold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>of very few persons indeed, and these of the very humblest
condition. And after the times of Jesus, Dositheus the
Samaritan also wished to persuade the Samaritans that he
was the Christ predicted by Moses; and he appears to have
gained over some to his views. But it is not absurd, in
quoting the extremely wise observation of that Gamaliel
named in the book of Acts, to show how those persons above
mentioned were strangers to the promise, being neither “sons
of God” nor “powers” of God, whereas Christ Jesus was
truly the Son of God. Now Gamaliel, in the passage
referred to, said: “If this counsel or this work be of men,
it will come to nought” (as also did the designs of those men
already mentioned after their death); “but if it be of God,
ye cannot overthrow this doctrine, lest haply ye be found even
to fight against God.”<a id='r1225'></a><a href='#f1225' class='c007'><sup>[1225]</sup></a> There was also Simon the Samaritan
magician, who wished to draw away certain by his magical
arts. And on that occasion he was successful; but now-a-days
it is impossible to find, I suppose, thirty of his followers
in the entire world, and probably I have even overstated the
number. There are exceedingly few in Palestine; while in
the rest of the world, through which he desired to spread
the glory of his name, you find it nowhere mentioned.
And where it is found, it is found quoted from the Acts of
the Apostles; so that it is to Christians that he owes this
mention of himself, the unmistakeable result having proved
that Simon was in no respect divine.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='fifty-eight'>LVIII.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>After these matters this Jew of Celsus, instead of the Magi
mentioned in the Gospel, says that “Chaldeans are spoken
of by Jesus as having been induced to come to him at his
birth, and to worship him while yet an infant as a God, and
to have made this known to Herod the tetrarch; and that the
latter sent and slew all the infants that had been born about
the same time, thinking that in this way he would ensure his
death among the others; and that he was led to do this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>through fear that, if Jesus lived to a sufficient age, he would
obtain the throne.” See now in this instance the blunder of
one who cannot distinguish between Magi and Chaldeans,
nor perceive that what they profess is different, and so has
falsified the Gospel narrative. I know not, moreover, why
he has passed by in silence the cause which led the Magi to
come, and why he has not stated, according to the scriptural
account, that it was a star seen by them in the east. Let us
see now what answer we have to make to these statements.
The star that was seen in the east we consider to have been
a new star, unlike any of the other well-known planetary
bodies, either those in the firmament above or those among
the lower orbs, but partaking of the nature of those celestial
bodies which appear at times, such as comets, or those meteors
which resemble beams of wood, or beards, or wine jars, or
any of those other names by which the Greeks are accustomed
to describe their varying appearances. And we establish
our position in the following manner.</p>
<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='fifty-nine'>LIX.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>It has been observed that, on the occurrence of great events,
and of mighty changes in terrestrial things, such stars are
wont to appear, indicating either the removal of dynasties or
the breaking out of wars, or the happening of such circumstances
as may cause commotions upon the earth. But we
have read in the <i>Treatise on Comets</i> by Chaeremon the Stoic,
that on some occasions also, when <i>good</i> was to happen, comets
made their appearance; and he gives an account of such
instances. If, then, at the commencement of new dynasties,
or on the occasion of other important events, there arises a
comet so called, or any similar celestial body, why should it
be matter of wonder that at the birth of Him who was to
introduce a new doctrine to the human race, and to make
known His teaching not only to Jews, but also to Greeks,
and to many of the barbarous nations besides, a star should
have arisen? Now I would say, that with respect to comets
there is no prophecy in circulation to the effect that such and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>such a comet was to arise in connection with a particular
kingdom or a particular time; but with respect to the appearance
of a star at the birth of Jesus there is a prophecy of
Balaam recorded by Moses to this effect: “There shall arise
a star out of Jacob, and a man shall rise up out of Israel.”<a id='r1226'></a><a href='#f1226' class='c007'><sup>[1226]</sup></a>
And now, if it shall be deemed necessary to examine the
narrative about the Magi, and the appearance of the star at
the birth of Jesus, the following is what we have to say,
partly in answer to the Greeks, and partly to the Jews.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='sixty'>LX.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>To the Greeks, then, I have to say that the Magi, being
on familiar terms with evil spirits, and invoking them for
such purposes as their knowledge and wishes extend to, bring
about such results only as do not appear to exceed the superhuman
power and strength of the evil spirits, and of the
spells which invoke them, to accomplish; but should some
greater manifestation of divinity be made, then the powers of
the evil spirits are overthrown, being unable to resist the
light of divinity. It is probable, therefore, that since at the
birth of Jesus “a multitude of the heavenly host,” as Luke
records, and as I believe, “praised God, saying, Glory to
God in the highest, and on earth peace, good-will towards
men,” the evil spirits on that account became feeble, and lost
their strength, the falsity of their sorcery being manifested,
and their power being broken; this overthrow being brought
about not only by the angels having visited the terrestrial
regions on account of the birth of Jesus, but also by the
power of Jesus Himself, and His innate divinity. The Magi,
accordingly, wishing to produce the customary results, which
formerly they used to perform by means of certain spells and
sorceries, sought to know the reason of their failure, conjecturing
the cause to be a great one; and beholding a divine
sign in the heaven, they desired to learn its signification. I
am therefore of opinion that, possessing as they did the prophecies
of Balaam, which Moses also records, inasmuch as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>Balaam was celebrated for such predictions, and finding
among them the prophecy about the star, and the words, “I
shall show him to him, but not now; I deem him happy,
although he will not be near,”<a id='r1227'></a><a href='#f1227' class='c007'><sup>[1227]</sup></a> they conjectured that the
man whose appearance had been foretold along with that of
the star, had actually come into the world; and having predetermined
that he was superior in power to all demons, and
to all common appearances and powers, they resolved to offer
him homage. They came, accordingly, to Judea, persuaded
that some king had been born; but not knowing over what
kingdom he was to reign, and being ignorant also of the place
of his birth, bringing gifts, which they offered to him as one
whose nature partook, if I may so speak, both of God and of
a mortal man,—gold, viz., as to a king; myrrh, as to one who
was mortal; and incense, as to a God; and they brought these
offerings after they had learned the place of His birth. But
since He was a God, the Saviour of the human race, raised
far above all those angels which minister to men, an angel
rewarded the piety of the Magi for their worship of Him, by
making known to them that they were not to go back to
Herod, but to return to their own homes by another way.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='sixty-one'>LXI.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>That Herod conspired against the child (although the Jew
of Celsus does not believe that this really happened), is not
to be wondered at. For wickedness is in a certain sense
blind, and would desire to defeat fate, as if it were stronger
than it. And this being Herod’s condition, he both believed
that a king of the Jews had been born, and yet cherished a
purpose contradictory of such a belief; not seeing that the
child is assuredly either a king and will come to the throne, or
that he is not to be a king, and that his death, therefore, will
be to no purpose. He desired accordingly to kill Him, his
mind being agitated by contending passions on account of
his wickedness, and being instigated by the blind and wicked
devil who from the very beginning plotted against the Saviour,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>imagining that He was and would become some mighty one.
An angel, however, perceiving the course of events, intimated
to Joseph, although Celsus may not believe it, that he was
to withdraw with the child and His mother into Egypt, while
Herod slew all the infants that were in Bethlehem and the
surrounding borders, in the hope that he would thus destroy
Him also who had been born King of the Jews. For he saw
not the sleepless guardian power that is around those who
deserve to be protected and preserved for the salvation of
men, of whom Jesus is the first, superior to all others in
honour and excellence, who was to be a King indeed, but
not in the sense that Herod supposed, but in that in which
it became God to bestow a kingdom,—for the benefit, viz.,
of those who were to be under His sway, who was to confer
no ordinary and unimportant blessings, so to speak, upon
His subjects, but who was to train them and to subject them
to laws that were truly from God. And Jesus, knowing this
well, and denying that He was a king in the sense that the
multitude expected, but declaring the superiority of His kingdom,
says: “If my kingdom were of this world, then would
my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews:
but now is my kingdom not of this world.”<a id='r1228'></a><a href='#f1228' class='c007'><sup>[1228]</sup></a> Now, if Celsus
had seen this, he would not have said: “But if, then, this
was done in order that you might not reign in his stead
when you had grown to man’s estate; why, after you did
reach that estate, do you not become a king, instead of
you, the Son of God, wandering about in so mean a condition,
hiding yourself through fear, and leading a miserable
life up and down?” Now, it is not dishonourable to avoid
exposing one’s self to dangers, but to guard carefully against
them, when this is done, not through fear of death, but from
a desire to benefit others by remaining in life, until the proper
time come for one who has assumed human nature to die a
death that will be useful to mankind. And this is plain to
him who reflects that Jesus died for the sake of men,—a
point of which we have spoken to the best of our ability in
the preceding pages.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>
  <h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='sixty-two'>LXII.</abbr></h4>
</div>
<p class='c005'>And after such statements, showing his ignorance even of
the number of the apostles, he proceeds thus: “Jesus having
gathered around him ten or eleven persons of notorious
character, the very wickedest of tax-gatherers and sailors,
fled in company with them from place to place, and obtained
his living in a shameful and importunate manner.” Let us
to the best of our power see what truth there is in such a
statement. It is manifest to us all who possess the Gospel
narratives, which Celsus does not appear even to have read,
that Jesus selected twelve apostles, and that of these Matthew
alone was a tax-gatherer; that when he calls them indiscriminately
sailors, he probably means James and John, because
they left their ship and their father Zebedee, and followed
Jesus; for Peter and his brother Andrew, who employed a
net to gain their necessary subsistence, must be classed not
as sailors, but as the Scripture describes them, as fishermen.
The Lebes<a id='r1229'></a><a href='#f1229' class='c007'><sup>[1229]</sup></a> also, who was a follower of Jesus, may
have been a tax-gatherer; but he was not of the number of
the apostles, except according to a statement in one of the
copies of Mark’s Gospel.<a id='r1230'></a><a href='#f1230' class='c007'><sup>[1230]</sup></a> And we have not ascertained
the employments of the remaining disciples, by which they
earned their livelihood before becoming disciples of Jesus.
I assert, therefore, in answer to such statements as the
above, that it is clear to all who are able to institute an
intelligent and candid examination into the history of the
apostles of Jesus, that it was by help of a divine power that
these men taught Christianity, and succeeded in leading
others to embrace the word of God. For it was not any
power of speaking, or any orderly arrangement of their message,
according to the arts of Grecian dialectics or rhetoric,
which was in them the effective cause of converting their
hearers. Nay, I am of opinion that if Jesus had selected
some individuals who were wise according to the apprehension
of the multitude, and who were fitted both to think and speak
so as to please them, and had used such as the ministers of His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>doctrine, He would most justly have been suspected of employing
artifices, like those philosophers who are the leaders
of certain sects, and consequently the promise respecting the
divinity of His doctrine would not have manifested itself; for
had the doctrine and the preaching consisted in the persuasive
utterance and arrangement of words, then faith also, like
that of the philosophers of the world in their opinions, would
have been through the wisdom of men, and not through the
power of God. Now, who is there, on seeing fishermen and
tax-gatherers, who had not acquired even the merest elements
of learning (as the Gospel relates of them, and in respect to
which Celsus believes that they speak the truth, inasmuch as
it is their own ignorance which they record), discoursing
boldly not only among the Jews of faith in Jesus, but also
preaching Him with success among other nations, would
not inquire whence they derived this power of persuasion,
as theirs was certainly not the common method followed by
the multitude? And who would not say that the promise,
“Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men,”<a id='r1231'></a><a href='#f1231' class='c007'><sup>[1231]</sup></a> had been
accomplished by Jesus in the history of His apostles by a sort
of divine power? And to this also, Paul, referring in terms
of commendation, as we have stated a little above, says:
“And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing
words of man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit
and of power; that your faith should not stand in the wisdom
of men, but in the power of God.”<a id='r1232'></a><a href='#f1232' class='c007'><sup>[1232]</sup></a> For, according to the
predictions in the prophets, foretelling the preaching of the
gospel, “the Lord gave the word in great power to them who
preached it, even the King of the powers of the Beloved,”<a id='r1233'></a><a href='#f1233' class='c007'><sup>[1233]</sup></a> in
order that the prophecy might be fulfilled which said, “His
word shall run very swiftly.”<a id='r1234'></a><a href='#f1234' class='c007'><sup>[1234]</sup></a> And we see that “the voice
of the apostles of Jesus has gone forth into all the earth, and
their words to the end of the world.”<a id='r1235'></a><a href='#f1235' class='c007'><sup>[1235]</sup></a> On this account are
they who hear the word powerfully proclaimed filled with
power, which they manifest both by their dispositions and
their lives, and by struggling even to death on behalf of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>truth; while some are altogether empty, although they profess
to believe in God through Jesus, inasmuch as, not possessing
any divine power, they have the appearance only of being
converted to the word of God. And although I have previously
mentioned a Gospel declaration uttered by the Saviour,
I shall nevertheless quote it again, as appropriate to the present
occasion, as it confirms both the divine manifestation of
our Saviour’s foreknowledge regarding the preaching of His
gospel, and the power of His word, which without the aid of
teachers gains the mastery over those who yield their assent
to persuasion accompanied with divine power; and the words
of Jesus referred to are, “The harvest is plenteous, but the
labourers are few; pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest,
that He will send forth labourers into His harvest.”<a id='r1236'></a><a href='#f1236' class='c007'><sup>[1236]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='sixty-three'>LXIII.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>And since Celsus has termed the apostles of Jesus men of
infamous notoriety, saying that they were tax-gatherers and
sailors of the vilest character, we have to remark, with respect
to this charge, that he seems, in order to bring an accusation
against Christianity, to believe the Gospel accounts only where
he pleases, and to express his disbelief of them, in order that
he may not be forced to admit the manifestations of Divinity
related in these same books; whereas one who sees the spirit
of truth by which the writers are influenced, ought, from
their narration of things of inferior importance, to believe also
the account of divine things. Now in the general Epistle of
Barnabas, from which perhaps Celsus took the statement that
the apostles were notoriously wicked men, it is recorded that
“Jesus selected His own apostles, as persons who were more
guilty of sin than all other evil-doers.”<a id='r1237'></a><a href='#f1237' class='c007'><sup>[1237]</sup></a> And in the Gospel
according to Luke, Peter says to Jesus, “Depart from me, O
Lord, for I am a sinful man.”<a id='r1238'></a><a href='#f1238' class='c007'><sup>[1238]</sup></a> Moreover, Paul, who himself
also at a later time became an apostle of Jesus, says in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>Epistle to Timothy, “This is a faithful saying, that Jesus
Christ came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the
chief.”<a id='r1239'></a><a href='#f1239' class='c007'><sup>[1239]</sup></a> And I do not know how Celsus should have forgotten
or not have thought of saying something about Paul, the
founder, after Jesus, of the churches that are in Christ. He
saw, probably, that anything he might say about that apostle
would require to be explained, in consistency with the fact
that, after being a persecutor of the church of God, and a
bitter opponent of believers, who went so far even as to deliver
over the disciples of Jesus to death, so great a change afterwards
passed over him, that he preached the gospel of Jesus
from Jerusalem round about to Illyricum, and was ambitious
to carry the glad tidings where he needed not to build upon
another man’s foundation, but to places where the gospel
of God in Christ had not been proclaimed at all. What
absurdity, therefore, is there, if Jesus, desiring to manifest to
the human race the power which He possesses to heal souls,
should have selected notorious and wicked men, and should
have raised them to such a degree of moral excellence, that
they became a pattern of the purest virtue to all who were
converted by their instrumentality to the gospel of Christ?</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='sixty-four'>LXIV.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>But if we were to reproach those who have been converted
with their former lives, then we would have occasion to accuse
Phædo also, even after he became a philosopher; since,
as the history relates, he was drawn away by Socrates from
a house of bad fame<a id='r1240'></a><a href='#f1240' class='c007'><sup>[1240]</sup></a> to the pursuits of philosophy. Nay,
even the licentious life of Polemo, the successor of Xenocrates,
will be a subject of reproach to philosophy; whereas
even in these instances we ought to regard it as a ground of
praise, that reasoning was enabled, by the persuasive power
of these men, to convert from the practice of such vices those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>who had been formerly entangled by them. Now among
the Greeks there was only one Phædo, I know not if there
were a second, and one Polemo, who betook themselves to
philosophy, after a licentious and most wicked life; while
with Jesus there were not only at the time we speak of, the
twelve disciples, but many more at all times, who, becoming
a band of temperate men, speak in the following terms of
their former lives: “For we ourselves also were sometimes
foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures,
living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one
another. But after that the kindness and love of God our
Saviour towards man appeared, by the washing of regeneration,
and renewing of the Holy Ghost, which He shed upon
us richly,”<a id='r1241'></a><a href='#f1241' class='c007'><sup>[1241]</sup></a> we became such as we are. For “God sent
forth His Word and healed them, and delivered them from
their destructions,”<a id='r1242'></a><a href='#f1242' class='c007'><sup>[1242]</sup></a> as the prophet taught in the book of
Psalms. And in addition to what has been already said, I
would add the following: that Chrysippus, in his treatise on
the <i>Cure of the Passions</i>, in his endeavours to restrain the
passions of the human soul, not pretending to determine
what opinions are the true ones, says that according to the
principles of the different sects are those to be cured who
have been brought under the dominion of the passions, and
continues: “And if pleasure be an end, then by it must the
passions be healed; and if there be three kinds of chief
blessings, still, according to this doctrine, it is in the same
way that those are to be freed from their passions who are
under their dominion;” whereas the assailants of Christianity
do not see in how many persons the passions have
been brought under restraint, and the flood of wickedness
checked, and savage manners softened by means of the
gospel. So that it well became those who are ever boasting
of their zeal for the public good, to make a public acknowledgment
of their thanks to that doctrine which by a new
method led men to abandon many vices, and to bear their
testimony at least to it, that even though not the truth, it has
at all events been productive of benefit to the human race.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>
  <h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='sixty-five'>LXV.</abbr></h4>
</div>
<p class='c005'>And since Jesus, in teaching His disciples not to be guilty
of rashness, gave them the precept, “If they persecute you
in this city, flee ye into another; and if they persecute you
in the other, flee again into a third,”<a id='r1243'></a><a href='#f1243' class='c007'><sup>[1243]</sup></a> to which teaching He
added the example of a consistent life, acting so as not to
expose Himself to danger rashly, or unseasonably, or without
good grounds; from this Celsus takes occasion to bring a malicious
and slanderous accusation,—the Jew whom he brings
forward saying to Jesus, “In company with your disciples
you go and hide yourself in different places.” Now similar to
what has thus been made the ground of a slanderous charge
against Jesus and His disciples, do we say was the conduct
recorded of Aristotle. This philosopher, seeing that a court
was about to be summoned to try him, on the ground of his
being guilty of impiety on account of certain of his philosophical
tenets which the Athenians regarded as impious, withdrew
from Athens, and fixed his school in Chalcis, defending
his course of procedure to his friends by saying, “Let us
depart from Athens, that we may not give the Athenians a
handle for incurring guilt a second time, as formerly in the
case of Socrates, and so prevent them from committing a
second act of impiety against philosophy.” He further says,
“that Jesus went about with his disciples, and obtained his
livelihood in a disgraceful and importunate manner.” Let
him show wherein lay the disgraceful and importunate element
in their manner of subsistence. For it is related in the Gospels,
that there were certain women who had been healed of their
diseases, among whom also was Susanna, who from their own
possessions afforded the disciples the means of support. And
who is there among philosophers, that, when devoting himself
to the service of his acquaintances, is not in the habit of receiving
from them what is needful for his wants? Or is it only
in them that such acts are proper and becoming; but when
the disciples of Jesus do the same, they are accused by Celsus
of obtaining their livelihood by disgraceful importunity?</p>

  <h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='sixty-six'>LXVI.</abbr></h4>
</div>
<p class='c005'>And in addition to the above, this Jew of Celsus afterwards
addresses Jesus: “What need, moreover, was there
that you, while still an infant, should be conveyed into Egypt?
Was it to escape being murdered? But then it was not
likely that a God should be afraid of death; and yet an
angel came down from heaven, commanding you and your
friends to flee, lest ye should be captured and put to death!
And was not the great God, who had already sent two angels
on your account, able to keep you, His only Son, there in
safety?” From these words Celsus seems to think that there
was no element of divinity in the human body and soul of
Jesus, but that His body was not even such as is described in
the fables of Homer; and with a taunt also at the blood of
Jesus which was shed upon the cross, he adds that it was not</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>We now, believing Jesus Himself, when He says respecting
His divinity, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life,”<a id='r1245'></a><a href='#f1245' class='c007'><sup>[1245]</sup></a>
and employs other terms of similar import; and when He says
respecting His being clothed with a human body, “And now
ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth,”<a id='r1246'></a><a href='#f1246' class='c007'><sup>[1246]</sup></a> conclude
that He was a kind of compound being. And so it
became Him who was making provision for His sojourning
in the world as a human being, not to expose Himself unseasonably
to the danger of death. And in like manner it was
necessary that He should be taken away by His parents,
acting under the instructions of an angel from heaven, who
communicated to them the divine will, saying on the first
occasion, “Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto
thee Mary thy wife; for that which is conceived in her is of
the Holy Ghost;”<a id='r1247'></a><a href='#f1247' class='c007'><sup>[1247]</sup></a> and on the second, “Arise, and take the
young child, and His mother, and flee into Egypt; and be
thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the
young child to destroy Him.”<a id='r1248'></a><a href='#f1248' class='c007'><sup>[1248]</sup></a> Now, what is recorded in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_473'>473</span>these words appears to me to be not at all marvellous. For
in either passage of Scripture it is stated that it was in a
dream that the angel spoke these words; and that in a dream
certain persons may have certain things pointed out to them
to do, is an event of frequent occurrence to many individuals,—the
impression on the mind being produced either by an
angel or by some other thing. Where, then, is the absurdity
in believing that He who had once become incarnate, should
be led also by human guidance to keep out of the way of
dangers? Not indeed from any impossibility that it should
be otherwise, but from the moral fitness that ways and means
should be made use of to ensure the safety of Jesus. And it
was certainly better that the child Jesus should escape the
snare of Herod, and should reside with His parents in Egypt
until the death of the conspirator, than that Divine Providence
should hinder the free will of Herod in his wish to
put the child to death, or that the fabled poetic helmet of
Hades should have been employed, or anything of a similar
kind done with respect to Jesus, or that they who came
to destroy Him should have been smitten with blindness like
the people of Sodom. For the sending of help to Him in a
very miraculous and unnecessarily public manner, would not
have been of any service to Him who wished to show that
as a man, to whom witness was borne by God, He possessed
within that form which was seen by the eyes of men some
higher element of divinity,—that which was properly the Son
of God—God the Word—the power of God, and the wisdom
of God—He who is called the Christ. But this is not a
suitable occasion for discussing the composite nature of the
incarnate Jesus; the investigation into such a subject being
for believers, so to speak, a sort of private question.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='sixty-seven'>LXVII.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>After the above, this Jew of Celsus, as if he were a Greek
who loved learning, and were well instructed in Greek literature,
continues: “The old mythological fables, which attributed
a divine origin to Perseus, and Amphion, and Æacus,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_474'>474</span>and Minos, were not believed by us. Nevertheless, that they
might not appear unworthy of credit, they represented the
deeds of these personages as great and wonderful, and truly
beyond the power of man; but what hast thou done that is
noble or wonderful either in deed or in word? Thou hast
made no manifestation to us, although they challenged you
in the temple to exhibit some unmistakeable sign that you
were the Son of God.” In reply to which we have to say:
Let the Greeks show to us, among those who have been
enumerated, any one whose deeds have been marked by a
utility and splendour extending to after generations, and
which have been so great as to produce a belief in the fables
which represented them as of divine descent. But these
Greeks can show us nothing regarding those men of whom
they speak, which is even inferior by a great degree to what
Jesus did; unless they take us back to their fables and histories,
wishing us to believe them without any reasonable
grounds, and to discredit the Gospel accounts even after the
clearest evidence. For we assert that the whole habitable
world contains evidence of the works of Jesus, in the existence
of those churches of God which have been founded
through Him by those who have been converted from the
practice of innumerable sins. And the name of Jesus can
still remove distractions from the minds of men, and expel
demons, and also take away diseases; and produce a marvellous
meekness of spirit and complete change of character,
and a humanity, and goodness, and gentleness in those individuals
who do not feign themselves to be Christians for
the sake of subsistence or the supply of any mortal wants,
but who have honestly accepted the doctrine concerning God
and Christ, and the judgment to come.</p>
<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='sixty-eight'>LXVIII.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>But after this, Celsus, having a suspicion that the great
works performed by Jesus, of which we have named a few
out of a great number, would be brought forward to view,
affects to grant that those statements may be true which are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_475'>475</span>made regarding His cures, or His resurrection, or the feeding
of a multitude with a few loaves, from which many fragments
remained over, or those other stories which Celsus thinks the
disciples have recorded as of a marvellous nature; and he
adds: “Well, let us believe that these were actually wrought
by you.” But then he immediately compares them to the
tricks of jugglers, who profess to do more wonderful things,
and to the feats performed by those who have been taught
by Egyptians, who in the middle of the market-place, in
return for a few obols, will impart the knowledge of their
most venerated arts, and will expel demons from men, and
dispel diseases, and invoke the souls of heroes, and exhibit
expensive banquets, and tables, and dishes, and dainties having
no real existence, and who will put in motion, as if alive,
what are not really living animals, but which have only the
appearance of life. And he asks, “Since, then, these persons
can perform such feats, shall we of necessity conclude that
they are ‘sons of God,’ or must we admit that they are the
proceedings of wicked men under the influence of an evil
spirit?” You see that by these expressions he allows, as it
were, the existence of magic. I do not know, however, if he
is the same who wrote several books against it. But, as it
helped his purpose, he compares the [miracles] related of
Jesus to the results produced by magic. There would indeed
be a resemblance between them, if Jesus, like the dealers in
magical arts, had performed His works only for show; but
now there is not a single juggler who, by means of his proceedings,
invites his spectators to reform their manners, or
trains those to the fear of God who are amazed at what they
see, nor who tries to persuade them so to live as men who are
to be justified<a id='r1249'></a><a href='#f1249' class='c007'><sup>[1249]</sup></a> by God. And jugglers do none of these
things, because they have neither the power nor the will, nor
any desire to busy themselves about the reformation of men,
inasmuch as their own lives are full of the grossest and most
notorious sins. But how should not He who, by the miracles
which He did, induced those who beheld the excellent results
to undertake the reformation of their characters, manifest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_476'>476</span>Himself not only to His genuine disciples, but also to others as
a pattern of most virtuous life, in order that His disciples
might devote themselves to the work of instructing men in
the will of God, and that the others, after being more fully
instructed by His word and character than by His miracles,
as to how they were to direct their lives, might in all their
conduct have a constant reference to the good pleasure of
the universal God? And if such were the life of Jesus, how
could any one with reason compare Him with the sect of
impostors, and not, on the contrary, believe, according to the
promise, that He was God, who appeared in human form to
do good to our race?</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='sixty-nine'>LXIX.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>After this, Celsus, confusing together the Christian doctrine
and the opinions of some heretical sect, and bringing
them forward as charges that were applicable to all who
believe in the divine word, says: “Such a body as yours
could not have belonged to God.” Now, in answer to this,
we have to say that Jesus, on entering into the world,
assumed, as one born of a woman, a human body, and one
which was capable of suffering a natural death. For which
reason, in addition to others, we say that He was also a great
wrestler;<a id='r1250'></a><a href='#f1250' class='c007'><sup>[1250]</sup></a> having, on account of His human body, been
tempted in all respects like other men, but no longer as men,
with sin as a consequence, but being altogether without sin.
For it is distinctly clear to us that “He did no sin, neither
was guile found in His mouth; and as one who knew no sin,”
God delivered Him up as pure for all who had sinned. Then
Celsus says: “The body of God would not have been so
generated as you, O Jesus, were.” He saw, besides, that if,
as it is written, it had been born, His body somehow might
be even more divine than that of the multitude, and in a
certain sense a body of God. But he disbelieves the accounts
of His conception by the Holy Ghost, and believes that He
was begotten by one Panthera, who corrupted the Virgin,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_477'>477</span>“because a God’s body would not have been so generated as
you were.” But we have spoken of these matters at greater
length in the preceding pages.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='seventy'>LXX.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>He asserts, moreover, that “the body of a god is not
nourished with such food [as was that of Jesus],” since he
is able to prove from the Gospel narratives both that He partook
of food, and food of a particular kind. Well, be it so.
Let him assert that He ate the passover with His disciples,
when He not only used the words, “With desire have I
desired to eat this passover with you,” but also actually
partook of the same. And let him say also, that He experienced
the sensation of thirst beside the well of Jacob,
and drank of the water of the well. In what respect do these
facts militate against what we have said respecting the nature
of His body? Moreover, it appears indubitable that after
His resurrection He ate a piece of fish; for, according to our
view, He assumed a [true] body, as one born of a woman.
“But,” objects Celsus, “the body of a god does not make
use of such a voice as that of Jesus, nor employ such a
method of persuasion as he.” These are, indeed, trifling
and altogether contemptible objections. For our reply to
him will be, that he who is believed among the Greeks to be
a god, viz. the Pythian and Didymean Apollo, makes use
of such a voice for his Pythian priestess at Delphi, and for
his prophetess at Miletus; and yet neither the Pythian nor
Didymean is charged by the Greeks with not being a god,
nor any other Grecian deity whose worship is established in
one place. And it was far better, surely, that a god should
employ a voice which, on account of its being uttered with
power, should produce an indescribable sort of persuasion in
the minds of the hearers.</p>
<h4 class='c010'>Chapter <abbr title='seventy-one'>LXXI.</abbr></h4>
<p class='c005'>Continuing to pour abuse upon Jesus as one who, on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_478'>478</span>account of his impiety and wicked opinions, was, so to speak,
hated by God, he asserts that “these tenets of his were
those of a wicked and God-hated sorcerer.” And yet, if the
name and the thing be properly examined, it will be found
an impossibility that man should be hated by God, seeing
God loves all existing things, and “hateth nothing of what
He has made,” for He created nothing in a spirit of hatred.
And if certain expressions in the prophets convey such an
impression, they are to be interpreted in accordance with
the general principle by which Scripture employs such language
with regard to God as if He were subject to human
affections. But what reply need be made to him who, while
professing to bring forward credible statements, thinks himself
bound to make use of calumnies and slanders against Jesus,
as if He were a wicked sorcerer? Such is not the procedure
of one who seeks to make good his case, but of one who is in
an ignorant and unphilosophic state of mind, inasmuch as
the proper course is to state the case, and candidly to investigate
it; and, according to the best of his ability, to bring
forward what occurs to him with regard to it. But as the
Jew of Celsus has, with the above remarks, brought to a
close his charges against Jesus, so we also shall here bring to
a termination the contents of our first book in reply to him.
And if God bestow the gift of that truth which destroys all
falsehood, agreeably to the words of the prayer, “Cut them
off in thy truth,”<a id='r1251'></a><a href='#f1251' class='c007'><sup>[1251]</sup></a> we shall begin, in what follows, the consideration
of the second appearance of the Jew, in which he
is represented by Celsus as addressing those who have become
converts to Jesus.</p>

and believe that He was seen after the resurrection; and when He came
to Peter and his companions, He said to them, Take and handle me,
and see that I am not an incorporeal spirit.’” Jerome, in his catalogue
of ecclesiastical writers, says the words are a quotation from the
Gospel of the Nazarenes, a work which he had recently translated.
Origen here quotes them, however, from <i>The Doctrine of Peter</i>, on which

<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r162'>162</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This passage is found in Jerome’s epistle to Avitus; and, literally
translated, his rendering is as follows: “If these (views) are not contrary
to the faith, we shall perhaps at some future time live without
bodies. But if he who is perfectly subject to Christ is understood to be
without a body, and all are to be subjected to Christ, we also shall be
without bodies when we have been completely subjected to Him. If all
have been subjected to God, all will lay aside their bodies, and the whole
nature of bodily things will be dissolved into nothing; but if, in the
second place, necessity shall demand, it will again come into existence
on account of the fall of rational creatures. For God has abandoned
souls to struggle and wrestling, that they may understand that they have
obtained a full and perfect victory, not by their own bravery, but by
the grace of God. And therefore I think that for a variety of causes are
different worlds created, and the errors of those refuted who contend
that worlds resemble each other.” A fragment of the Greek original of
the above is found in the epistle of Justinian to the patriarch of Constantinople.
“If the things subject to Christ shall at the end be subjected
also to God, all will lay aside their bodies; and then, I think, there will
be a dissolution (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀνάλυσις</span>) of the nature of bodies into non-existence
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰς τὸ μὴ ὄν</span>), to come a second time into existence, if rational (beings)
should again gradually come down (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑποκαταβῇ</span>).”</p>

being subject to Christ, we shall be subject to God, and God shall be all
in all; or, as things subject to Christ will be subject along with Christ
Himself to God, and enclosed in one covenant, so all substance will be
reduced to the best quality and dissolved into an ether, which is of a
purer and simpler nature; or at least that sphere which we have called
above <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀπλανῆ</span>, and whatever is contained within its circumference (<i>circulo</i>),
will be dissolved into nothing, but that one by which the anti-zone
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀντιζώνη</span>) itself is held together and surrounded will be called a good
land; and, moreover, another sphere which surrounds this very earth
itself with its revolution, and is called heaven, will be preserved for a
habitation of the saints.”</p>

translated, are as follow: “Whence infinite caution is to be employed,
lest perchance, after souls have obtained salvation and come to the
blessed life, they should cease to be souls. For as our Lord and Saviour
came to seek and to save what was lost, that it might cease to be lost;
so the soul which was lost, and for whose salvation the Lord came, shall,
when it has been saved, cease to be a soul. This point in like manner
must be examined, whether, as that which has been lost was at one time
not lost, and a time will come when it will be no longer lost; so also at
some time a soul may not have been a soul, and a time may be when it
will by no means continue to be a soul.” A portion of the above is
also found, in the original Greek, in the Emperor Justinian’s letter to
Menas, Patriarch of Constantinople.</p>

virtues, will become an understanding. For if we examine the case of
Esau, we may find that he was condemned because of his ancient sins in
a worse course of life. And respecting the heavenly bodies we must
inquire, that not at the time when the world was created did the soul of
the sun, or whatever else it ought to be called, begin to exist, but before
that it entered that shining and burning body. We may hold similar
opinions regarding the moon and stars, that, for the foregoing reasons,
they were compelled, unwillingly, to subject themselves to vanity on
account of the rewards of the future; and to do, not their own will, but
the will of their Creator, by whom they were arranged among their
different offices.”—<i>Jerome’s Letter to Avitus.</i> From these, as well as

cognisable by the understanding, God, by His own will, caused to exist
as great a number of intelligent beings as was sufficient; for we must
say that the power of God is finite, and not, under pretence of praising
Him, take away His limitation. For if the divine power be infinite, it
must of necessity be unable to understand even itself, since that which is
naturally illimitable is incapable of being comprehended. He made
things therefore so great as to be able to apprehend and keep them under
His power, and control them by His providence; so also He prepared
matter of such a size (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τοσαύτην ὕλην</span>) as He had the power to ornament.”</p>

commentators. The words are: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Quæ ergo ista est præter hæc voluntas

<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“extrinsecus”</span> as meaning <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“seorsim,”</span> <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“insuper,”</span> and refers to a note of
Origen upon the Epistle to the Romans (tom. <abbr title='one'>i.</abbr> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 466): <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Et idcirco

3, 4) <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">apostolus non nominat, sed carnem tantum vel spiritum,”</span> etc.
Schnitzer supposes that in the Greek the words were, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Τῆς ἔξω καλουμένης,</span>
where <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔξω</span> is to be taken in the sense of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κάτω</span>, so that the expression

<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r735'>735</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The following is Jerome’s version of this passage (Epistle to Avitus):
“A divine habitation, and a true rest above (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>apud superos</i></span>), I think is
to be understood, where rational creatures dwelt, and where, before
their descent to a lower position, and removal from invisible to visible
[worlds], and fall to earth, and need of gross bodies, they enjoyed a
former blessedness. Whence God the Creator made for them bodies
suitable to their humble position, and created this visible world, and
sent into the world ministers for the salvation and correction of those
who had fallen: of whom some were to obtain certain localities, and be
subject to the necessities of the world; others were to discharge with
care and attention the duties enjoined upon them at all times, and which
were known to God, the Arranger [of all things]. And of these, the
sun, moon, and stars, which are called ‘creature’ by the apostle,
received the more elevated places of the world. Which ‘creature’ was
made subject to vanity, in that it was clothed with gross bodies, and
was open to view; and yet was subject to vanity, not voluntarily, but
because of the will of Him who subjected the same in hope.” And
again: “While others, whom we believe to be angels, at different places
and times, which the Arranger alone knows, serve the government of
the world.” And a little further on: “Which order of things is regulated
by the providential government of the whole world; some powers
falling down from a loftier position, others gradually sinking to earth:
some falling voluntarily, others being cast down against their will:
some undertaking, of their own accord, the service of stretching out
the hand to those who fall; others being compelled to persevere for
so long a time in the duty which they have undertaken.” And
again: “Whence it follows that, on account of the various movements,
various worlds also are created; and after this world which we now
inhabit, there will be another greatly dissimilar. But no other being
save God alone, the Creator of all things, can arrange the deserts [of
all], both to the time to come and to that which preceded, suitably
to the differing lapses and advances [of individuals], and to the
rewards of virtues or the punishment of vices, both in the present
and in the future, and in all [times], and to conduct them all again
to one end: for He knows the causes why He allows some to enjoy
their own will, and to fall from a higher rank to the lowest condition;
and why He begins to visit others, and bring them back gradually, as if
by giving them His hand, to their pristine state, and placing them in a
lofty position” (Ruæus).</p>

again from the end, it is a question whether then also there will
be bodies, or whether existence will be maintained at some time without
them when they shall have been annihilated, and thus the life of
incorporeal beings must be believed to be incorporeal, as we know is
the case with God. And there is no doubt that if all the bodies which
are termed visible by the apostle, belong to that sensible world, the life
of incorporeal beings will be incorporeal.” And a little after: “That
expression, also, used by the apostle, ‘The whole creation will be freed
from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children
of God’ (<abbr title='Romans'>Rom.</abbr> <abbr title='eight'>viii.</abbr> 21), we so understand, that we say it was the first
creation of rational and incorporeal beings which is not subject to corruption,
because it was not clothed with bodies; for wherever bodies
are, corruption immediately follows. But afterwards it will be freed
from the bondage of corruption, when they shall have received the glory
of the sons of God, and God shall be all in all.” And in the same place:
“That we must believe the end of all things to be incorporeal, the
language of the Saviour Himself leads us to think, when He says, ‘As
I and Thou are one, so may they also be one in us’ (John <abbr title='seventeen'>xvii.</abbr> 21).
For we ought to know what God is, and what the Saviour will be in
the end, and how the likeness of the Father and the Son has been promised
to the saints; for as they are one in Him, so they also are one in
them. For we must adopt the view, either that the God of all things is
clothed with a body, and as we are enveloped with flesh, so He also with
some material covering, that the likeness of the life of God may be in
the end produced also in the saints; or if this hypothesis is unbecoming,
especially in the judgment of those who desire, even in the smallest
degree, to feel the majesty of God, and to look upon the glory of His
uncreated and all-surpassing nature, we are forced to adopt the other
alternative, and despair either of attaining any likeness to God, if we
are to inhabit for ever the same bodies, or if the blessedness of the same
life with God is promised to us, we must live in the same state as that
in which God lives.” All these points have been omitted by Rufinus as
erroneous, and statements of a different kind here and there inserted
instead (Ruæus).</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r755'>755</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Here the honesty of Rufinus in his translation seems very suspicious;
for Origen’s well-known opinion regarding the sins and lapses
of blessed spirits he here attributes to others. Nay, even the opinion
which he introduces Origen as ascribing to others, he exhibits him as
refuting a little further on, <abbr title='section'>sec.</abbr> 6, in these words: ‘And in this
condition [of blessedness] we are to believe that, by the will of the
Creator, it will abide for ever without any change,’ etc. I suspect,
therefore, that all this is due to Rufinus himself, and that he has inserted
it, instead of what is found in the beginning of the chapter, <abbr title='section'>sec.</abbr> 1, and
which in Jerome’s Epistle to Avitus stands as follows: ‘Nor is there
any doubt that, after certain intervals of time, matter will again exist,
and bodies be formed, and a diversity be established in the world, on
account of the varying wills of rational creatures, who, after [enjoying]
perfect blessedness down to the end of all things, have gradually fallen
away to a lower condition, and received into them so much wickedness,
that they are converted into an opposite condition, by their unwillingness
to retain their original state, and to preserve their blessedness uncorrupted.
Nor is this point to be suppressed, that many rational creatures
retain their first condition (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>principium</i></span>) even to the second and third
and fourth worlds, and allow no room for any change within them;
while others, again, will lose so little of their pristine state, that they
will appear to have lost almost nothing, and some are to be precipitated
with great destruction into the lowest pit. And God, the disposer of
all things, when creating His worlds, knows how to treat each individual
agreeably to his merits, and He is acquainted with the occasions and
causes by which the government (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>gubernacla</i></span>) of the world is sustained
and commenced; so that he who surpassed all others in wickedness, and
brought himself completely down to the earth, is made in another
world, which is afterwards to be formed, a devil, the beginning of the
creation of the Lord (Job <abbr title='forty'>xl.</abbr> 19), to be mocked by the angels who
have lost the virtue of their original condition’ (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>exordii virtutem</i></span>).”—<span class='sc'>Ruæus.</span></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r768'>768</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Jerome (Epistle to Avitus, <abbr title='number'>No.</abbr> 94) says that Origen, “after a most
lengthened discussion, in which he asserts that all bodily nature is to be
changed into attenuated and spiritual bodies, and that all substance is
to be converted into one body of perfect purity, and more brilliant than
any splendour (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>mundissimum et omni splendore purius</i></span>), and such as
the human mind cannot now conceive,” adds at the last, “And God
will be ‘all in all,’ so that the whole of bodily nature may be reduced
into that substance which is better than all others, into the divine, viz.,
than which none is better.” From which, since it seems to follow that
God possesses a body, although of extreme tenuity (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>licet tenuissimum</i></span>),
Rufinus has either suppressed this view, or altered the meaning of
Origen’s words (Ruæus).</p>

seems very confused. Probably also the text is corrupt. The

the <i>ab</i> we approximate to the Greek, and get: “but he, whoever he be,

<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r1088'>1088</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Origen’s most important contribution to biblical literature was his
elaborate attempt to rectify the text of the Septuagint by collating it
with the Hebrew original and other Greek versions. On this he spent
twenty-eight years, during which he travelled through the East collecting
materials. The form in which he first issued the result of his labours
was that of the <i>Tetrapla</i>, which presented in four columns the texts of the
<abbr title='Septuagint'>LXX.</abbr>, Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion. He next issued the <i>Hexapla</i>,
in which the Hebrew text was given, first in Hebrew and then in Greek
letters. Of some books he gave two additional Greek versions, whence
the title <i>Octapla</i>; and there was even a seventh Greek version added
for some books. Unhappily this great work, which extended to nearly
fifty volumes, was never transcribed, and so perished (Kitto, <i>Cycl.</i>).</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
